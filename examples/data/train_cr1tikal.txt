Moist Meter | Animal Crossing: New Horizons

this episode is brought to you by Ray

Khan I was an animal crossing virgin

until new horizons came out and I have

to say this is not the kind of game I've

ever really enjoyed but this game

fucking bangs I've had so much fun and I

can fully see why so many people get so

invested in the game there's just so

much to do in it and it's a never ending

experience now for me personally I found

most of the fun to be sharing the

experience with others i streamed a lot

of animal crossing at twitch.tv slash

moist critical and the most fun would be

when i opened up the floodgates and let

the stream come in I'd march right up to

my airport staff I'd say Orville unlock

that door he'd look at me with tears in

his eyes and say Charlie please not

again we can't handle more of this and

I'd say Orville open that fucking door

falling into a deeper sadness Orville

would remind me Charlie the Internet's a

weird place and we've had trouble with

some of these degenerates using your

island like a fleshlight are you

positive and I'd say Orville don't take

that tone with me again we're opening

the gates the PTSD would set in he'd go

into a hysterical fit but he'd opened

those gates and we let the internet

stream come in and I basically turned my

island to a sexual paradise basically I

turned my island into only fans and it

was a magical experience the community

came together you know I'd have I'd hire

some of the people to water some of my

plants while I was out fetching some

wood so I could build another chair

there was just so much to do the amount

of things you can do in Animal Crossing

is astonishing and honestly and it

wasn't just sharing the experience with

my streams Tiana and I played a lot of

animal crossing off streams she really

enjoyed the grind and it was fun playing

that with her so I think this is the

game that fits extremely well for anyone

looking for a really laid-back kind of

game or just a casual game to play with

someone that's really not even a gamer

because there's a lot to do you can

decorate your house in all kinds of

different ways decorate everything on

the island customize so much shit you

can terraform your island into multiple

different ways again fuckin waterfalls

run through your shit you can really

design something truly unique and fun

the only thing is this is not a game I'd

recommend everyone the pacing in this

game is a

extremely slow and I typically don't

like that but I didn't mind it in this

game because I mean the grind was

enjoyable it's very colourful the

characters are fun to talk to I mean I

just don't really have any complaints

about the game to be honest but I see

why a lot of people wouldn't like it

because the entire game is basically a

giant fetch quest it's a never-ending

fetch quest series and that's not

exactly fun the fun comes from when you

complete that and then build your shit

but for a lot of people it's going to be

pretty relaxing and even therapeutic to

a certain degree just to cast your

fishing line out there and catch

yourself a golden trout at some point

it's just a really really casual

laid-back game that has a lot of depth

to it if you're willing to give it that

chance so you could really build

something wild that the giant fucking

Empire on your Island and I appreciate

that the possibilities in this game are

actually endless and I mean that with no

exaggeration you can do pretty much

anything you can dream of for your

Island the customization is wild I went

to someone's Island and they had their

entire house decorated in pokey Maine

posters and also a satanic ritual room

to try and summon pokey main it was

crazy what they were able to do the only

negative things I can think about the

game are just how slow of a burn it is

and again I usually hate that but I

didn't mind it here but I definitely see

why a lot of people would especially the

beginning in particular it is super slow

you'll only be making like one fucking

flower in the beginning then having the

weight a full day also everything

happens in real time so one one day in

the real world is one day in the game

the only way around that is changing the

time on your Nintendo switch which full

full transparency I did in fact I

time-traveled 40 years into the future

just to see what my island would look

like so I traveled to the far-off future

of 2060 and let me tell you right now

Tom Nook is an immortal he might be a

vampire I'm not quite sure maybe the

Fountain of Youth exists on the island

there's no real telling but in 2060 it

was identical to 2020 so a bit

disappointed there I was hoping you know

all the characters would have like

graying beards or something look like

some fucking wizards out of a Tolkien

novel but that didn't happen what I'm

saying is if you're going to play this

without time switching which a lot of

people

you consider cheating I don't I don't

see any problem with it it's just

progressing in the game at a different

pace at your own pace since it is a

personalized experience I don't see

anything wrong with it but there's a lot

of people that take issue and if you're

not going to do that you're going to be

kind of bored for like the first three

days because you're not going to have a

whole lot of shit to do it's very

limited in what you have available to

you in the beginning and it doesn't

really open itself up until you start

really getting shit cranking like in a

week maybe and it's not that's not a bad

thing either because maybe for some

people the experience will be you know

hopping on the game for an hour to a day

and just doing some chores getting some

things set up and then the next day the

buildings are complete and then you go

from there

it's gonna be different for everyone and

I really think it just offers a lot to

just a casual experience that's really

customizable so plugging Animal Crossing

new horizon into the moist meter I'm

giving this bad boy a 90 percent I

really didn't expect to like this game

but I ended up really liking this game

so yeah that that's about it

it's time to talk about rake on again

I've recommended these bad boys plenty

of times by now I use them for the gym I

think they're fantastic when it comes to

anything active there are wireless

earbuds but let's face it most gyms are

closed right now and you're probably not

gonna be going to the gym unless you're

trying to weather the apocalypse that's

no excuse not to work out and be active

though you can do all kinds of body

weight exercises calisthenics at home

and if you're gonna be doing those

you're gonna need some boner jams

blastin so you got to get some rake on

earbuds they sound just as amazing as

the other top audio brands but they come

in at half the price the everyday e

twenty fives are the best model so I

still recommend that one it's 15% off if

you click the link in the description so

if you're interested in Rey Khan at all

feel free to click the link for 15%

Moist Meter | Doom Eternal

this episode of moist maida was brought

to you by - Lane welcome to the moist

metres today we're taking a look at doom

eternal follow-up to the mega-hit doom

2016 a game that I absolutely adored and

I'm happy to say doom eternal is an

improvement in every possible area over

doom 2016 the game is extraordinary it's

a game that made me feel like a bigger

stronger man just from fucking playing

the game from the very second you turn

on the game and you're greeted with the

incredible soundtrack from Nick Gordon

you know you're in for a fucking

high-octane thrill ride it's so badass

it's gonna make you want to get a barbed

wire tattoo while you're playing the

game it's just so good from the very

second the game starts it grabs you by

the nutsack and never lets go it

constantly just has you putting your

cock on the chin of demons constantly

the pacing is relentless

full throttle aggression non-stop action

it makes it feel like your blood has

been replaced by diesel fuel it is so

incredible it's such a refreshing

experience the the FPS gameplay is so

crisp so smooth the movement is

magnificent there's so many new

mechanics this time around - it's a lot

deeper than doom 2016 a lot of weapon

variety and a lot of different purposes

for each weapon so you'd be constantly

switching in between weapons during a

fight because you're gonna be mixing and

matching what works best against what

enemy let's say you need armor well

maybe you'll use the flame belch and

then hit them with a blood punch that we

did like this fat fucking pinata

explosion of armor drops it's so good

there's a lot more strategy to it a lot

more depth and it's a lot more fluid it

just feels incredible when you go

through a slayer gate which is a really

challenging optional arena that you can

do and if you beat it you get a key

which unlocks a powerful weapon if you

collect enough those keys you'll go

through this gauntlet of thousands of

demons this is hoard of meat that just

comes after you from the most pathetic

pitiful small demons you know the demons

from the person that pirated a movie one

time - these fucking hulking gigantic

beasts of legend

and you'll grit your teeth and fail

multiple times on nightmare difficulty

until you finally triumph and get that

incredible or Lord but all the while

that you're getting your ass pounded it

doesn't hurt it feels great because the

maps are so well designed to compliment

high life like high-flying action and

just constant movement that it just

always is fun just to get in there even

if you are getting your shit pushed in

and you will eventually get better and

push through it regardless of your level

of talent in the game because you'll

want to because it's so goddamn fun it

is just so enjoyable and I also like to

say the narrative in this game I

actually really enjoyed I thought the

narrative was really entertaining albeit

not the best written thing ever made or

anything but it was super fun and it

shows you just how fucking cool doom guy

is you know just this remarkably

imposing presence that every one man

woman child demon angel God himself

fears and regrets creating it's just

really cool to have this really badass

character and have a story all wrapped

around how badass he is I just really

enjoyed that and I can't compliment the

soundtrack enough by the way because the

soundtrack throughout the entire

campaign is just a straight-up banger

real boner jams from doom eternal really

really solid stuff there everything is

great the aesthetic design every level

feels nice to play every map is so

fucking nice to play around with the

only thing I felt was even a little bit

clunky was swimming I don't know why

they even included swimming and just

slowed everything down and it's not like

they were puzzles or anything it was

more just a chore finding exactly what

you needed to bash into I just don't

really understand why swimming was even

here that's like the only thing I could

even criticize in the entire game

because everything else was fantastic

finding secrets was fun going off the

beaten path and exploring was fun and of

course just massacring hordes of demons

never got old I I can't I cannot express

enough how much I enjoyed the campaign

the campaign was nice and long as well

so you get a lot of bang for your buck

in the campaign and then there is

multiplayer the multiplayer I don't

think is bad but I also don't really

think it's good it's just kind of really

me

it's just something that's kind of like

this aftermath like you're riding the

high beating the campaign and you want

more and there is more there's a master

levels and shit but there's also

multiplayer if you want like even more

and you'll go from like a full chub

after the campaign to just kind of going

a little soft from the multiplayer again

it's not bad it's simple there's a

slayer there's two demons it's a 1v2

scenario you go against demons as you

would in the campaign you have regular

AI demons that you fight you get all the

shit you got from them in the campaign

but there are two demons that are picked

by human players and they're trying to

kill you obviously so if you kill both

demons you win if you kill one demon the

other demon has a respawn timer and if

he responds you have to kill them both

again you have to kill them both before

one of them responds that's how the

Slayer wins and the demons went

obviously if they kill you there's a

bunch of different powers that the

demons can use there's loadouts that you

can use different ability cards shit

like that there is a little bit of depth

to it but I just didn't really find

myself enjoying it all that much I just

think it was wasted potential not to

create a multiplayer that was an arena

shooter using the gameplay of doom

eternal because it would have fit

absolutely beautifully with an arena

shooter style and I know arena shooters

are pretty much dead these days and I

think it's a shame because arena

shooters are a lot of fun especially

when they're done well and I think it

could have been done well here maybe in

the future they'll add that I don't

really know but as it stands the

multiplayer is just kind of like this

afterthought like you're not going to be

getting this game to get lost in the

multiplayer that's just going to be

something that you remember when you're

just bored after beating the game for

the fifth time over on ultra nightmare

it's just just not great not bad

and it doesn't bring the game down I'd

say I don't think it really takes it

down a notch or anything so plugging

doom eternal into the moist meter I'm

giving it a phat 95% everything in this

game is done super well it is the most

fun I've had with a shooter in a long

long time it is absolutely extraordinary

i streamed the whole thing at twitch.tv

slash moist critical you can see that I

was an absolute monster at this game by

the way so I was able to push this

shit to its maximum potential I was

surprised the game didn't fucking crash

on me with the stress testing I was

putting it through incredible game so

much you can do with it and I can't

recommend it enough if you're a fan of

high paced first-person shooting action

great stuff I want to talk about the

modern internet age we have to memorize

a ton of passwords for a ton of

different things or if you're some

caveman using one password for

everything you need to stop that ASAP

this is an intervention you need to stop

doing that you should have multiple

passwords for a lot of different things

and it sometimes becomes a bit of a

burden to remember those or if you write

them down remembering to write them down

or finding where you wrote them down it

just becomes a hassle and password

recoveries often times not very

efficient where you have to answer these

questions like what was the name of your

grandmother's first goldfish and then

you don't remember and then you're

locked out it can just be a big headache

which is why I want to talk about - lane

- Lane eliminates the problem entirely

it has all the passwords you need when

you need them it's super quick super

simple one-click log in anywhere you

need so you never have to worry about

fumbling around with remembering what

goes where there's no ads which is great

it's not doing anything shady with your

data because - Lane can't even see your

data and there's no credit card required

so they're not scamming you or anything

out of money it's just an all-around

great product that just makes the online

living space much more quick efficient

Moist Meter | Nioh 2

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're taking a look at neo -

this was my most anticipated game of

2020 and it fills me with immense joy

and a fat chubbin my pants to tell you

that the game exceeded my expectations

the game expands upon everything that

made the first one so great and it keeps

it still very familiar so it's not a

huge departure from the formula that was

an absolute hit that being said there's

some obvious shortcomings that we're

gonna talk about let's start with what

makes neo to so fucking great the first

thing I want to talk about is the depth

neo 2 has so much to do in it in just so

many different ways of approaching the

game it's unreal

I put 36 hours into the game streamed

all of it at twitch.tv slash Moyes

critical and I only scratched the

surface of what neo 2 has to offer

I switched my build three times I

started with a magic switch glaive build

then I went into a Barenaked badass axe

wielding build and then eventually

settled on a ninjutsu build all of which

functioned entirely different from one

another that play style was constantly

changing as the builds were there's just

so much versatility there's so many

stats that dictate so many different

changes and everything in the game has

its own set of bonuses there's even set

bonuses if you're matching multiple

things from the same set every weapon

every piece of armor if you find a

fucking butt-plug that's coming with

bonuses and every role is RNG unless you

go to the blacksmith the temperate and

the bonuses have different rarities

there's common for something like a

small resistance to something massively

game-changing like plus 50 to your

ninjutsu there's just so much shit and

just so much to this game it is the

deepest souls like game that is out

there hands down and there's different

stances that dictate different play

styles that you can change on the fly

during a combo and you can just keep an

enemy stunned it's just beautiful the

combat in the gameplay everything in

this flow is so incredibly well it's

just always fun to experiment with

different skill combos or a different

way of approaching an enemy and every

enemy in this game hits like a fucking

truck even if you're wearing full tank

armor you can get one shot by a basic

enemy if you find a caterpillar crawling

around to decide to attack it that shit

might just turn

bite your dick off and just end you

immediately and I think that's great

puts hair on the chest of anyone that

picks up the controller to play the game

you accidentally swing at a rock well it

turns out that rock was a wall in it one

shot to you shit is crazy you got to

stay on your toes at all times

it's a fucking joy I absolutely love

everything about neo from a gameplay

perspective and the depth of this game I

really can't stress enough is incredible

so many different ways of playing it and

I love it now I want to get it to a

couple of its shortcomings I hate the

mission system I think Neos biggest

shortcoming is this mission system and

it's exactly the same as an eel one

there's no changes to it everything

including the interface is identical

with almost no quality of life

adjustments for menus or anything like

that the inventory is still a convoluted

fucking mess to manage that I just don't

like the interface in the mission system

those are the probably the two biggest

complaints I have about the game and

they're not even like a huge deal it's

just really tedious

you know traversing the menu getting

where you want to get but I think what

makes me dislike the mission system so

much isn't from a functionality

standpoint because it gets you where you

need to go but it just makes it a little

underwhelming at how it keeps taking you

out of the action so you'll finish an

incredible mission and then you just

leave and then you go to a different

location that maybe isn't as cool where

is in something like Dark Souls the fun

is exploring and going from place to

place the place and ending up in all

kinds of locations you know you can very

well accidentally limp-dick idli wander

into an extremely high-level area in a

Dark Souls game without knowing it in

neo that's never going to happen because

it's such a handheld experience with the

mission system dropping you in and

having it be a very linear way that you

progress there's really no sense of

exploration

yeah there's little things that you can

find here and they're scattered

throughout the small mission zones but

you're never gonna go from zone to zone

without getting kicked out of the

mission and put there literally fucking

air-dropped OD STD into that mission and

I just think that's a big part of the

souls like genre is having these really

well-designed maps and worlds that you

just explore in with no hand-holding and

no idea really where to go and I think

that's something very unique and special

to the genre that neo doesn't have at

all another negative thing about neo is

the camera will often betray you

god forbid you have a fight in a close

quarters area in a little house or a

little hut or something like maybe you

come in for a fucking tea and then

you're getting ambushed by five enemies

that camera is going fucking wild the

camera will get stuck in a wall

sometimes it'll accidentally zoom in

into someone's asshole you're just all

disoriented and then you absolutely get

gangbanged in there and lose and it's

not your fault it's because the camera

didn't even show you what was going on

but that's not something that happens

overly often nine times out of ten the

camera is exactly where you want it to

be so it's not that big of a deal but

it's something that almost everyone's

going to experience for sure when

playing the game narrative Lee I always

loved Neos story I really like the way

they tell the story and also just what

they do is they use actual people from

Japanese history but then you know bring

this fantasy element of it to life so

you have these real characters like

Nobunaga Hideyoshi they have all of

these characters from the history and

then they bring them in here and they

tell a really cool story

yeah the writing isn't phenomenal and

yes the English voice acting sounds lazy

as shit sounds like some fucking porn

parody acting level shit but it's still

an interesting story and I like what

they do with taking real historical

characters and adding fantasy to it I

think it's really nice you know you have

these real characters Hideyoshi Nobunaga

and then you put them in this game with

all this fantasy fantasy shit going on

around them and I think that's really

cool so I like the narrative but I can

absolutely see some people not liking it

a lot of it is told through just

pictures not relieved in cutscenes and

the animation in the cutscenes that are

here sometimes pretty rough but I'm a

fan of it I don't think it took away

from the experience and I don't think

anyone was gonna be playing neo2 for the

narrative in the first place anyway if

you're getting neo to what you're

playing it for is the incredible

unmatched high octane full nuts to butts

massive testosterone pumping action and

neo 2 delivers it is it just has so much

I didn't even touch on soul cores yokai

shifting I barely even told you how much

there is in there for gameplay min min

maxing you could spend hours just coming

up with builds and getting the right

rolls on your equipment it is so

impressive how much there is to this

game I'd also like to mention the ball

there's a ton of bosses in this game and

all of them look extremely cool you'll

go into a boss fight and just be blown

away like holy shit that looks badass

and he's about to shake me down for my

lunch money it's just really fucking

cool and the bosses always have your

really unique attack patterns unique

attacks and unique beams so I was really

impressed because they really ramped it

up from neo one where I thought the

bosses were a little lackluster they're

much better in this game however I do

have to say there's a few bosses in here

that I think mechanically were designed

shittily there's a couple bosses in here

where their idea for difficulty was just

cranking up their health to an insane

amount for example Shibata that's like

slapping a brick wall with a wet noodle

you'll be chipping away at his health so

slowly for so fucking long it's just I

don't think that was a smart design

choice to make it difficult because all

it did was artificially make the fight

longer not harder

it was just tedious and frustrating and

then there was the monster house I'm

blanking on its name but it's just this

fucking house that has tentacles coming

out full hentai style you're fighting

for tentacles at once and then there's

two other tentacles that will come in

and hit you with a one-shot laser beam

that you only hear audio you can't see

it it's not telegraphed so you just have

to be very closely paying attention to

the audio and I think that's a little

unfair especially during all the hectic

chaos from four other tentacles firing

ice balls fire balls and fat fucking

balls everywhere so I just feel like

some of the bosses were designed poorly

for the sake of making it difficult when

it really wasn't difficult just kind of

unfair or tedious but otherwise I think

neo2 is an incredible fucking game that

I can't recommend enough to anyone that

like souls like games action games or

any games with a lot of men maxing

potential there's so much to do in neo

so plugging this into the moist meter

I'm giving neo to a fat 90 percent super

happy with how great the game is also

I'd like to apologize I didn't stream

the final boss kill because if you were

tuning into the streams I was doing for

neo 2 twitch.tv slash Moyes critical my

internet cut out when we were finishing

the final boss and it was 3 a.m. so I

just went to bed and then I beat him the

next morning so just letting you all

know now that's what happened and I'm

sorry I just fucking late and I didn't

feel like restarting the streaming it in

the

all set up again but anyway neo - great

game highly recommend good shit so yeah

Moist Meter | The Hunt

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're taking a look at the

hunt I've seen more advertisements for

this movie than any other movie of the

last few years the marketing budget for

this movie must be more than Disney's

because this shit was being crammed up

my ass constantly with new trailers and

with every trailer I saw I got less and

less interested I didn't think it was

gonna be a very good movie I thought it

was just gonna be a kind of Twitter

argument the movie because that's what

it looked like

you know there's fucking professional 30

year olds that argue with 16 year olds

on Twitter daily and that's the kind of

energy I got from the trailers but I'm

happy to say it was a good movie I

enjoyed it this is obviously a very

politically driven movie and the movie

never really takes aside it seems to

just you know take shots in both sides

equally and it doesn't really seem like

it has all that much to say aside from

just being an enjoyable satire that

being said I think the comedy blows ass

in this movie that might be a personal

taste because I'm not a huge fan of

political comedy that shit just kind of

makes me roll my eyes but in here it's

really heavy-handed on the nose easy

shit for example when a character is

dying another character goes over to

them as they're fading out and says

climate change is real and shit like

that that's the kind of humor that

you're you're in store for when you buy

a ticket for the hunt so if you're going

for the comedy aspect I don't think it

works well at least in the dialog

there's physical comedy bits that I

think work really well especially in the

first act the first act of this movie I

think is very strong well when

characters start talking to each other

it's fucking terrible it's listening to

two redditors trying out and lighten

each other it's it's awful stuff I

really didn't care for the dialogue and

there's only one likeable character

which is Betty Gilpin's character

Betty Gilpin carries this shit out of

this movie she is great and just an

excellent badass character that you can

actually route for which is especially

refreshing given every other character

around her only ever speaks in politics

there's not a single conversation that

happens between characters that isn't

politically driven I'm not exaggerating

every conversation begins in

with political discussion even when

they're mid gunfight it's oh these

liberal cooks always talking about

climate change or something or in the

other realm oh these redneck fucks

always talking about sister Kissin it's

just a it's a they can't talk to each

other it's only political Facebook posts

that they vomited each other it's so

hard to listen to the dialogue but and

that's a real shame because it brings

down an otherwise really fun movie the

action I think is so well shot and

really well done especially in the first

act I think the first act is by by far

the strongest part of the movie it's

even hard to realize who you're even

gonna be following who's the main

character of the story because so much

is getting tossed at you at once and I

think that's great so you're constantly

surprised there's constant twists

there's a little to discover and then at

the end of the movie they have a

beautiful beautifully choreographed

final fight that I think is just really

enjoyable overall the movies just really

well put together it objectively it is a

well-made movie it is well acted

especially by Betty Gilpin it's just I

feel it went so hard on politics that

everything had to be political it

couldn't have just subtlety subtlety is

never a word you'll hear tossed around

when talking about this movie I doubt

because there's none of that here it's

not very clever and it's writing or

anything and I think that just brings

everything down a peg because everywhere

else it was pretty successful at what it

wanted to do when it wanted to do action

it did it right it did it well when it

wanted to do an emotional moment with

the main character it doesn't really

well she has some some interesting

things to say and some good speeches cuz

she's really one of the only characters

that can kind of talk to people and have

things to say about things that isn't

just you know the pseudo-intellectual

political jargon and I you know I

overall I do say it's a good movie but I

think you're gonna need to go in there

with some low expectations regardless of

what side the political spectrum you're

on there's going to be you know jabs

tossed your way which i think is good

and you know they throw a nice balance

of everything out there I don't think

any of its particularly well-written or

anything

but they at least try this movie doesn't

take a side it's just pretty much right

down the middle it's yeah I I think it's

a pretty inoffensive movie to be honest

I think the controversy is really

overblown plugging this into the moist

meter I'm giving it a 65 percent I

enjoyed the movie I think it's a good

movie but I also think it's a movie

that's gonna make a lot of people just

kind of sigh because a lot of this shit

and it's just kind of embarrassing to

watch and listen to but overall it's a

good movie that's about it so yeah

Moist Meter | Onward

this episode was brought to you by

manscaped initiating moisture I just got

out of the shower which is why my hair

looks like the girl from the grudge

right now

I saw onward Disney Pixar's latest

animated movie I don't have a whole lot

to say about it because at this point

Pixar is just synonymous with quality

when you go to a Pixar movie you know

you're at least getting a good well-made

and beautiful looking movie those things

all hold true for onward though onward I

would say is one of the better Pixar

movies of recent times because at least

this time it's a totally original story

I felt for a little while Pixar was just

kind of rehashing the same shit over and

over again just turning in the same

homework and this time it's a totally

unique one it's a story of two brothers

whose father died long before this movie

takes place and at the 16th birthday for

one of the brothers he left behind a

magical spell to bring him back for a

day but the magic spell goes awry and

they only get his lower half so they

have his legs cocked balls and ass and

it's up to them to find a rare gym to

power the spell to get the top half and

it's a kind of a really enjoyable

adventure that's pretty emotional I'd

say they go on a grand quest to find

this the older brother is a big gamer

nerd Dungeons & Dragons jerking off kind

of guy and he leads them down this quest

through mythology magic and just good

times it's an enjoyable movie as you'd

expect I can say with full confidence

you won't be bored with the movie I will

say that comedy isn't very good even in

a theater that was filled with children

almost none of the kids were laughing

and I think that's because the movie

tried a little harder to be more you

know one or two jokes but mainly just

focusing on a cool quest which is fine

but the jokes they had didn't really

land with anyone not even kids so you

kind of you kind of missed a mark on

that one but other than that I really

have no negatives to say about it

I don't think it's an extremely special

movie nothing that's gonna reinvent the

wheel or anything like that but it is a

very good one that's well put together

in a world that I think is very

interesting with all these creatures

elves

Pixies unicorns dragons man man yeah

there's that beautiful magic baby I'd

also like to say the ending to this

movie is extremely strong I think the

ending to this is probably the best part

of the movie it's really satisfying and

it gives a totally different perspective

to the entire movie which I really

appreciate so the ending I think is

absolutely great and the whole movie

again while the themes aren't anything

totally unique they're explored in a

really nice way and a super creative

world and it's just an enjoyable quest I

wish they went a little harder on like

the gamers shit you know like they slay

a monster and then the older brother

starts teabagging them and then

references Halo or some shit but again

if it takes all of these gamer elements

and puts it into really wholesome

crafted adventure it's a this was gonna

be like the shortest moist meter ever

but when it's Pixar it really kind of

speaks for itself like you're gonna see

it if you like animated movies already

yeah you don't need my seal of approval

on I need the fucking stamp that for you

probably already got tickets this didn't

really have like a marketing campaign I

think I only saw two or three trailers

so I didn't have an expectation really

knowing Pixar I kind of had a sneaking

suspicion to be good which it was

because somehow Pixar cannot make a bad

movie even when they're telling the same

story again and again and again it is

still enjoyable to watch that same story

again and again and again I this is

going to offend anime fans but anime

does the same thing where you'll have

like the exact same main character

across like 50 different animes and shit

half of those animes are still great and

you still like the main character that's

what Pixar is able to do with animation

and this again is unique although like

the messages and the themes aren't it

doesn't creative spin on it especially

with the ending that I really like so

plugging this into the moist meter I'm

giving onward a big old 85% I have no

issues with the movie other than the

comedy not making me hahaha and giggle

real loud but other than that I love the

D&D quest they go on I love the themes

and I really just enjoyed it start to

finish that's about it and I'd like to

now tell you about the last time I

shaved my balls because I used manscape

and I didn't hurt myself this time I've

mentioned manscape before as you know

I've told the horror story I've once cut

my shaft from shave

accidents using old electric razors have

not had that issue so far with manscaped

if I could whip out my cock on this

video right now I would you can see how

beautifully clean shaven it is it's all

thanks to manscape and they're

Moist Meter | The Invisible Man

initiating moisture the Invisible Man is

perhaps the biggest surprise I've gotten

in a movie theater since the time I

nearly got a handjob during a movie this

movie I expected to be fucking terrible

based on the trailers the trailers

basically spoiled the entire movie

whoever made those trailers needs to be

fired when you watch the trailer for

Invisible Man you sittin down and

watching an entire fucking movie

basically start finished twists and all

but somehow the Invisible Man is able to

rise above the trailers and just be

incredibly enjoyable very clever writing

Elizabeth moss the lead she absolutely

fucking crushes it she sells her

performance super well and it's just a

joy to watch the whole movie I just

can't believe is as good as it is but

I'm being serious

fire that fucking dude that made the

trailer I don't know what intern you

hired that day or you know high school

student put that together but that was

terrible

that's how you make a movie look like a

joke before it comes out because this is

a movie people were making fun of based

on that trailer myself included but it's

a great movie and I didn't know this

going into it with the same director

behind upgrade made this one and that

man is on fucking fire that man is

absolutely slapping ass so I'm a big fan

and let's dive into Invisible Man here

so obviously the message of the movie is

abusive relationships constantly

haunting you no matter what and you can

see the damage throughout the entire

movie on Elizabeth moss for what she

went through with her abusive acts

Adrian who was a super genius basically

Jimmy Neutron I will not be spoiling

anything in this but if you see the

trailer which I really advise you don't

you're gonna be spoiled on a few things

what this could be considered a minor

spoiler so four warning I really wish

they didn't ever release that trailer

because I would have loved the idea of

not knowing whether or not Elizabeth

moss was crazy in the trailer they show

you that it is truly an Invisible Man

doing these things but I really loved

the idea of it being Elizabeth moss

doing these things thinking that it's

still her abusive ex which I think would

have been really a clever way to play

with the audience and I feel like that's

the vibe they wanted to hit but the

trailer ruined it because it shows you

everything which is a fucking shame so I

don't know if anyone's gonna consider

that a spoiler or not considering its

the trailers but regardless it's a bit

of a missed opportunity there anyway

though it really does hit most of its

marks

there's jump scares in here as you'd

expect I guess even though I don't

really think it's supposed to be a

horror movie they have these like really

uncharacteristic jump scares which is

kind of cheap and a little lazy some

like indie game developer jump scare

level shit which isn't really that kind

of like a bad thing but it's just kind

of asking yourself well why doesn't

really do anything for it he's still a

menacing presence just knowing that he's

there and seeing Elizabeth mouths react

to knowing that he's there even though

you can't see him and I think they did a

great job making Adrienne's presence

just truly evil and a lot of horror

movies you'll have the invisible threat

but it's doing dumb shit like opening

the refrigerator and taking a bite out

of your Apple peeing in your toilet

ghost pee you know who did that

that wasn't me and then you know that's

kind of boring shit but when Adrienne's

torturing Elizabeth

he doesn't in a really smart fashion

frames all of it on her so everyone

thinks she's crazy has her thinking

she's crazy it's just really

well-executed to make him this really

powerful evil presence in her life and

on screen and I just really love the way

the movies written to be honest it's

just really well put together towards

the end it gets a little silly but it

brings itself back for fantastic

conclusion there is just a little bit of

silliness towards the end where it

starts pulling a bit out of the ass and

you have to start suspending your

disbelief and some of the shit they try

and get out there but even still it

wraps itself up beautifully and

justifies that little that little bump

in the road so I really don't have a

whole lot of complaints about the movie

to be honest it's never boring at any

point because I mean shit even you as

the audience member don't know what the

fuck Adrienne's gonna do cuz you don't

see him it's not like in you know halo 2

when you get the camouflage you can

still see the outline you don't see him

until Elizabeth moss makes you see him

so you as an audience member are

constantly wondering if Adrian's about

this step in and do some crazy fucking

shit so I really just loved the way they

with all of that I really liked the

execution and surprisingly just a super

solid movie it really was plugging

Invisible Man into the voice meter I'm

giving it a fat old eighty five percent

it could have been a lot better if I'd

never seen the trailer or they just

didn't use that fucking trailer in the

first place because there was a whole

lot more that could have been done with

the idea of her being insane and well

the trailer ruined any possibility about

happening that's about it good movie big

surprise and big fan of the director

that's about it see ya

Moist Meter | My Hero Academia: Heroes Rising

this episode of moist maida was brought

to you by keeps welcome to the moist

meter today we're taking a look at my

hero academia heroes rising this is the

second movie from the my hero anime

franchise and the first one was great

this one's even better I think now it's

not canon and I'm of the firm belief if

you're gonna make something that's not

canon just go fucking hog wild with that

shit I don't care if it makes sense just

make it fun and over-the-top as fuck

bring in time-traveling space pirates

have the main characters steal the fist

of God I really don't care because it's

not canon just make that shit memorable

and that's exactly what this movie does

it I'll get the only negative out of the

way about the movie the narrative it's

it's weak the narratives not great but

what the narrative does is it allows the

stage to be set to have every member of

the class come in and showcase their

talents and their quirks and have them

work together team up against these four

new villains which are all pretty cool

and I really like that they're bringing

the class as the front row and center

because as the anime progresses

naturally they're dialing in on the main

characters and focusing there so you're

seeing less and less of the side

characters so it's nice to have this

movie bring them back into the spotlight

and show you that hey you know they're

not useless they can do some cool shit I

mean a couple of them are useless but

for the most part they can do some cool

shit and that movie shows it and I love

that but the narrative it's not great

it's really not especially towards the

end towards the end of this movie they

are really pulling some fat shit out of

their ass they're going to fist deep and

just yanking as much shit out as

possible it's really fun and man that

final fight is super beautiful to look

at but it makes no sense

and when they try to explain some of the

nonsensical shit it's weaker than a 20

year old condom it is just by all

definitions some ass pulling which is

fine because it's not canon comes with

the territory and it just showed you

some really fucking awesome shit so it's

not that big of a deal that they don't

have a real explanation or excuse for

why certain things happened but I mean

fucking deku and baka leo died 15 times

in this movie spoiler alert when you see

them on screen their death is soon to

follow

but they always get brought back because

explanations I mean it's an exaggeration

of course but it really is very silly in

that department which i think is fine

because it's not canon as long as it's

cool memorable and just an enjoyable

experience I think it really hits the

marks that it's looking for I do think

if you haven't seen the show there's

really not a whole lot here for you

because part of the fun of this movie is

seeing those characters that you haven't

seen in like two fucking seasons

contributing again doing cool shit again

and I really enjoyed that I felt like I

felt like the gang was getting back

together you know getting back on the

ice ready to play a couple more hockey

games here in the big league

so that was really enjoyable another

complaint I did have there's four new

villains introduced in this movie but

only two of them have any stage presence

at all two of them are just thrown away

almost immediately there's two villains

in that group that I think had three

lines of dialogue in five minutes

combined of screen time so I just kind

of wasted on those two because I think

they were really cool and I think their

quirks were pretty interesting that they

didn't explore at all they were just

kind of used as a little flashlight and

punching bag toss to the side which i

think is a bit of wasted potential but

the two villains from the group that did

stand out really fucking stood out

they're really great especially the main

bad guy 9 I think he was fantastic

intimidating menacing and just a really

great final boss fight and that final

fight lasts like 45 minutes that's the

bulk of this movie is just the last

fight and it is beautiful every second

of the way and that's when all the

heroes are really firing on all

cylinders doing some cool shit I'm very

I was very pleased with the movie there

is a lot you could pick apart especially

when you come to the narrative side of

things and some of the decisions they

made but why the fuck would you it's not

canon in the first place anyway so just

let them have these explanations I would

have been totally fine if the way they

excused it was at the end it was all a

dream

I wouldn't even fucking cared at that

point it was just a really enjoyable

experience the animation here and that

final fight is gorgeous absolutely

gorgeous I'm a sucker for that kind of

shit at the end where this climactic

battle has like nine different acts to

it all over the course of 45 minutes and

then towards the final act I just cut

everything and it's just

ambient noise and

music I love that I love that shit

overall very enjoyable movie was hype as

fuck plugging this into the moist meter

I'm giving my hero academia Heroes

rising a nice eighty-five percent very

good stuff and it right in line with the

show the shows good movies good so it's

nice that they are both good together

neither one of them stinky which is

fantastic

time we talked about something serious

here boys hair gloss nothing to be

embarrassed about it's also something

you don't have to deal with statistics

and I'm not using these to scare you but

statistics say two out of three men will

experience some form of male pattern

baldness by the time they're 35 that is

unacceptable I say especially when

there's other options out there I'm

talking of course about keeps keeps will

help you keep that beautiful lion's mane

looking beautiful they offer actual

treatments real scientifically proven

effective treatments

none of that pseudoscience garbage

you'll find on the internet about you

know rubbing motor oil in your skull to

help with preventing hair loss

none of that real actual proven

efficient effective treatments keeps

preventing hair loss you can also talk

to a doctor through keeps to get

medicate medication prescribed and

delivered right to your doorstep there

Moist Meter | Sonic the Hedgehog

this episode is brought to you by Ray

Khan from the first trailer for Sonic

the Hedgehog dropped it was love at

first sight for me I was expecting a

beautifully entertaining disaster on the

same level of the great something like

food fight and then they announced that

they were gonna completely redesign

Sonic due to the backlash and then they

actually made a competent looking sonic

which was what we have in the movie

today and I will say that single

decision in the redesign saved the movie

the movies actually pretty good but if

you think about the version 1.0 and I

swear to god they need to release the

fuck in 1.0 I will pay for another

ticket just to go see it in its original

form because the original Sonic for

those that don't remember looked like a

sex offender in a fur suit and when you

watch this movie and just picture that

original abomination sitting there

talking to the characters interacting

making the jokes it does my god the

movie falls apart it more than falls

apart honestly that's an understatement

it would be annihilated pissed and shit

on it then kept that original design in

this movie with some of these scenes it

would look like a porn parody instead of

a family-friendly Sonic movie so hats

off the moving picture company the

animation studio behind Sonic's redesign

they actually saved the entire franchise

it's probably been the final nail in

Sonic's coffin in the public eye and it

saves Sega the most embarrassing

disaster since the Sega Genesis so they

should really be sucking moving-picture

company's dick or their ass or something

but they can't because moving picture

company has closed its doors because

animation studios visual effects artists

they don't get paid what they deserve so

the entire studio had to close which

means the sonic redesign is their swan

song that's a whole different can of

worms but hats off to the people behind

the redesign it actually saved the movie

like I said the movies pretty good it's

not bad it's generic and it's very

clearly for kids and it does really well

in that area I imagine kids loved it

people in the theater with their kids

they were having a great time and it's

not bad it doesn't hurt to sit through

something like a painful experience but

it very clearly is aimed at a younger

demographic Sonic flosses twice and it's

not just quick flossy there's like a

whole flossing routine they make it

clear who their target audience is there

are a couple of

little humdingers that they throw in

there that are actually kind of clever

jokes and I think Jim Carrey is

extremely strong in the movie but

overall all the humor all the comedy and

all the pacing is really meant for a

younger audience which that's no big

deal yeah it's a sonic movie you kind of

expect that not saying Sonic fans can't

be adults I I know you're out there

jerking off the sonic hentai and shit I

get it

that shit's been around since the

invention of the Internet I'm very

familiar I'm saying this movie

particular is geared for a younger

audience so you might not find Prime

mister battery material in this one

there are some really cool moments in

the movie though I'd say and especially

when it comes to their fighting it's not

exactly fighting don't go in there

expecting something like you know raid

or it men's style choreography or

anything like that but when it comes to

their fights I like what they do with

Sonic's speed and to give you a sense of

just how fast he is they do and this

isn't a spoiler they do what they did in

x-men to show Quicksilver where time

stands still and they interact with the

world in slow motion while they're still

going fast and they change things around

and then all speeds up at once you get

to see this chaos that unfolds that's

Sonic's signature move and it really

looks cool on screen I'm kind of a

sucker for that shit cuz I think it's

just really nice to look at and I really

think it's it's creative so I do respect

that and I like the way they did the

action and the chemistry between Sonic

and the main character Tom well he's not

really the main character they they

share the equals screen time when one's

on screen the others on screen fucking

fisting each other and shit chuckling

each other not actually fisting again

it's not that kind of Sonic movie

they're together a lot and Tom and him

have a great on-screen chemistry and not

that I think Sonic is real like they

hired the real Sonic is the actor but

the dialogue between them is cute is

what I'm saying there's is really

nothing wrong with the movie there's

nothing great about the movie I think

it's pretty forgettable unless you were

a real hard Sonic fan which I know a lot

of people are I think it does the

character justice and really this is

probably the best they could have done

with opening a Sonic the Hedgehog

universe I think it was well done they

had an origin they had you know the

introduction to these characters beloved

ones such as Robotnik and Sonic it's

just I think they did everything they

needed to do and they did it well enough

really surprising because I expected

this to be a lot worse than it was

even setting aside how

awful the original design looked and

when I say awful I mean beautifully

awful I if you haven't seen the original

sonic the hedghog design that they

released with this do yourself a favor

imagine like your creepy uncle in one of

those mascots outside of a used gamed

store twirling a sign and you know

having a fucking heat exhaustion that's

the kind of costuming and the kind of

character that they had in the original

Sonic the Hedgehog I don't know what the

fuck went on with that CGI with Christ

it was beautifully awful is it setting

that aside I still expected the movie to

be bad because that's how they

envisioned Sonic and it looked like shit

well how else did they envision the

story and you know everything else along

with it not just the design I thought it

was all going to be super misguided and

shitty but it wasn't it was fine

plugging Sonic the Hedgehog into the

moist meter given this bad boy a crisp

60 percent again pretty good movie I

don't think it was anything more than

generic ly good it didn't have anything

impressive to offer or anything in that

regard but I do think Sonic fans and

just younger audience members are

probably gonna really enjoy the movie

and I think that's what it was really

aiming to do so it accomplished its goal

you already know what time it is it's

time to give you something to jerk off

about we're talking about ray cons again

maybe the wireless earphones of the

future talked about them numerous times

bow down you already know I use them

every time I go to the gym because you

can't have wires dangling in front of

your fucking face and ruining your reps

because you have wires or yanking them

out of your ears and shit so when you're

doing these reps and anything that

requires physical activity these wires

are very intrusive and you know for me

personally if my flawless technique at

the gym I can't be distracted by that

kind of hindrance which is why you've

got to go wireless

and Ray Caan is the best option for that

they sound just as amazing as other

premium audio brands but come at a lower

price point it also just came out with

their newest model the e25 six hours of

playtime seamless bluetooth pairing

compact all the bells and whistles so if

you're interested click the link in the

description to get 15% off your rake on

order I highly recommend them as I have

multiple times in the past so again 15%

off if you click the link in the

Moist Meter | Birds of Prey

this episode was brought to you by sir

shark for eighty-three percent off a

two-year plan visit sir shock Deal /

penguin for a while DC movies were a

joke and everyone just kind of went to

laugh at them or just be utterly

disappointed to see characters they

loved ruined on the big screen they had

movies like Batman vs Superman Justice

League and Suicide Squad Suicide Squad I

still believe is just an utter

hemorrhoid of a movie and probably the

worst superhero movie of the last 20

years just truly abominable work for

quite a while they went on this

impressive streak of just terrible

movies but now they've really started to

turn it around I don't know who the fuck

they fired at DC headquarters but great

decision in that department because the

movies they've been pumping out have

been pretty much bangers and

birds-of-prey is another good movie into

this hot streak it's not great it's not

as good as the other DC movies that have

come out recently Aquaman Shazam and

such but it is a good movie the best

part about this movie is the decision

they made to bring the team behind John

wick to do their action scenes for this

one that was extremely smart because

that's the best part about birds of prey

as the action scenes the action scenes

are so beautifully choreographed with

really exciting set pieces and every

action scene has its own unique style to

it it's just really enjoyable so huge

props to the John wick action

choreography Department for what they've

done here cuz it absolutely shines in

this movie in particular Harley Quinn

she's the most fun to launch in a fight

because she's constantly flipping around

and shit it looks like cirque du soleil

she's doing like fucking head spins like

in WWE and then she's like breakdancing

on top of people's heads to snap their

neck it's it's some crazy shit and it's

really enjoyable to watch the second

best part about birds of prey is their

decision to totally distance itself from

Suicide Squad I expected this movie to

be a disaster because it's following me

worst superhero movie that Hollywood has

ever puked out Suicide Squad I thought

there'd be a tight connection

I thought we'd be seeing a lot more of

Jared Leto's despicable performances the

Joker but then immediately they let you

know you're not even gonna see him you

don't even see a fucking snippet of him

you don't see a fucking reflection of

him which is great a great decision

because he was terrible even DC divorced

themselves from Jared Leto's

which is the smartest thing I could've

done the movie immediately picks up

after Harley Quinn and Joker breakup and

it's about her dealing with being alone

now being her own woman and coming into

her own identity instead of just being

the sidekick to the Joker and they

explore it pretty well margot robbie

does a good job both in the emotional

side of things and the quips i suppose

even though I think that's really tired

they do way too much of that and I think

it just becomes oversaturated it's just

it's over it's over plod

you fucking blasting my ass with

constant Harley Quinn isms and it's just

too much at a certain point but when

they were doing the emotional stuff I

felt like she delivered a great

performance and I just couldn't be

happier that it doesn't have a tight

connection to Suicide Squad I am so glad

we don't have to deal with anything that

that movie tried to do or set up and

let's just totally fucking forget that

it ever happened like x-men origins

Wolverine and those are the two best

parts of the movie by far the things I

didn't like about the movie was the

narrative the narrative is simple

there's nothing wrong with the narrative

you know a pickpocket steals a diamond

she's a kid and now that diamond was

really important so everyone's after the

kid and they're after Harley Quinn

because they want to kill her because I

don't like her simple stuff but I don't

like the way they delivered the

narrative especially in the beginning

because the movie started out with

here's some shit going on and then

Harley Quinn as she's narrating breaking

the fourth wall says wait just a minute

you don't know what's going on let's

rewind a week so I can tell you what's

going on I was you know queefing in the

bathroom and then I ordered this burrito

taco and you're wacky stuff and then it

catches itself up and she says wait just

a minute here's a character you don't

know let's back up for days and tell you

about this character and then you watch

that shit and then it catches back up

wait a minute it's just fucking

frustrating at a certain point and it

gets a little convoluted it's

unnecessary I think it just tried really

hard to be a bit wacky which absolutely

cost it in the narrative department

there's really nothing wrong with it and

I really like the characters they

introduced canary Huntress and

especially eewan MacGregor as Roman

sionis I really enjoyed even for at

least for the beginning part of the

movie because he was really fucking

feeling himself he was clearly having a

lot of fun just being this hammy

character cartoonishly evil I'm

surprised he didn't have a handlebar

moustache that he was twirling her for

half the movie his his shit was just

comically

overbearing evil like he peels people's

fucking faces off and then he was gonna

let someone go and then peels their face

off because he didn't like the snot in

their nose it's some goofy shit and I

love the way MacGregor played it I

thought it was super enjoyable he was

great but towards the end of the movie

they just never gave it a rest and so it

just became a little too much and a

little just again the same problem they

had with Harlequin just too fucking much

of what made them good it becomes it

starts to make you want to roll your

eyes which is a shame but still I

enjoyed it there's nothing wrong with

the movie fundamentally I don't think

it's like a bad movie but there's

absolutely some things that I think are

flawed with it mainly in its

storytelling and just in the way they

handle the humor cuz I think the comedy

just doesn't land all that often it

tries to do that XD random shit from

like a decade ago where she's obsessed

with food like oh this is the perfect

egg sandwich and I sandwich so great

it'll make your mother shit her pants

oh no I didn't get to eat my egg

sandwich I lost what I truly loved damn

you shit like that I don't care for that

and they do that's like the main way

they do humor in this movie I don't

think the dialogue for comedy is strong

but during their action scenes they

throw in some physical comedy and I

think that works so that might be the

John wick team again who knows but there

anything involving physicality in this

movie I thought worked beautifully

including the comedy that they interval

it that they wove in to their action

scenes there's one more thing I feel I

need to mention when talking about this

movie it's not like the Charlie's Angels

reboot wherein the Charlie's Angels

reboot being literally the first fucking

scene is some misogynistic asshole

saying women can't do half the things a

man can do can a woman make a car go

fast no only the callused grease hands

of a man can do that just misogynistic

shit like that mirja pray isn't that

kind of movie it doesn't do those kind

of things yeah the main villain is a

misogynistic asshole but he's also a

fucking guy that you're supposed to hate

who peels the faces off of people and

has no problem killing kids it's not at

all like Charlie's Angels reboot which

is good so plugging birds-of-prey into

the moist meter giving this a fat 70% I

think it's just an all-around enjoyable

movie where the best parts of it is the

action and luckily there's a lot of

action

and yeah I really did enjoy it which is

I didn't expect to just because of how

bad Suicide Squad is but I was

pleasantly surprised and great decision

to bring in the John wick team fuck yeah

the Internet can be a scary place you

don't need me to tell you about that I

need to gather you around the campfire

and tell you internet horror stories or

anything but I think it's worth noting

how can you protect yourself that's why

I want to talk about surf sharks sir

shark is a very robust VPN I'm sure all

of us are familiar with VPNs these days

because they're pretty much a necessity

at this point we all know that privacy

benefits the security benefits surf

shark helps encrypt all of your data

sent over the internet so it protects

your messages and everything in that

regard but also it's aside from just the

security benefits you get using a VPN

you're also able to help yourself in the

entertainment world let's say Netflix is

region-locked your favorite show - a

place - you're not in you can use the

VPN surf shark to change your location

at area and watch that show no hassle

it's simple it's easy and sir shark VPN

is extremely robust it also comes with a

whitelist feature so that way it doesn't

accidentally block something you want to

access you can always whitelist whatever

you want which is a great feature that I

really appreciate so if you're

interested you can go to surf shark deal

slash penguin to get 83% off a two-year

plan plus one extra month free at surf

shark that deals slash penguin for

eighty-three percent off that two-year

plan and a free month baby

Moist Meter | The Gentlemen

this episode was brought to you by

manscaped welcome to the moist meter

today were looking at the gentlemen I

didn't know shit about this movie going

into it I hadn't seen any trailers all I

knew it was Guy Ritchie's newest

production I haven't been too big of a

fan of Guy Ritchie's recent work save

for a couple some of them have just been

pretty goddamn stinky to be honest but I

still like his work so I was enough to

get me pretty interested in the movie

and I'll be honest it surprised me with

how good it was it put a finger way up

my asshole and gave me a big surprise

with how much I enjoyed it I was

expecting it to just be kind of mediocre

and just pretty safe but it's definitely

more than that it's a very good movie

with very good performances from the

main cast I really enjoy the narrative

the most it has a really great story to

tell which in a nutshell is about a man

who sells drugs who gets into some hot

deep shit and things start to get messy

and that shit's got to get cleaned up I

like the way they tell the story they

have Hugh Grant retro actively telling

you the events that happened and he

embellishes them from time to time which

makes it really cool it's a nice little

element to it and then sometimes you

have to even question whether or not the

information you're being fed by him is

even real if that's what happened which

is great I enjoyed that quite a bit and

I really liked how the plot starts to

get convoluted in the middle and the end

convoluted in a good way that's not a

negative not like a fucking Kojima

convoluted plot where you got a baby in

a pickle jar and then all of a sudden

you're getting hunted by a fucking

time-traveling vampire garbage man

everything makes sense in its universe

and it's really great to have all these

moving parts it gets a bit chaotic it's

just a really enjoyable story that I

liked from start to finish and I really

like the way they executed it but more

than that I like the way the characters

interacted with one another for example

when you had two friends that were all

in the drug business together they'd

talk and they you know constantly

calling themselves you know you're a

stiff cunt you're a what console op econ

soggy con all that kind of shit just

cute little playful banter between each

other that was goofy at times but always

felt just right just the right amount of

goofy and wackiness and I loved it even

some of the comedic one-liners landed

pretty well I thought it was just really

enjoyable even when the characters

didn't like each other like

characters that fucking hate each other

they give these like super villain

monologues to one another and then end

it by calling them a dusty cunt really

in general the dialogue just slapped the

main complaint I have about the movie is

it should have ended 10 minutes before

it actually did it's the same problem I

had with baby drivers ending it just

goes way too far for the sake of closure

where it wants to close off every

possible loop that any redditor could

possibly think of and it's to the

detriment of the movie because it had a

great stopping point a super strong

final act that I thought wrapped up

lovely and then out of nowhere it brings

something else and and it's not out of

nowhere it's something they hint at but

it's something that they didn't need to

do at all and it added nothing to the

narrative the plot and the universe of

the characters really and it only lasted

two scenes there's only two scenes that

popped up at the end that were super

quick probably about a minute of screen

time total before that's totally

resolved and they spend the next nine or

ten minutes talking about that and like

over explaining why that happened and

the repercussions of such it was just

unnecessary it didn't know when to close

the curtain it'd be like if you went to

show-and-tell and the fucking class went

wild for the first thing you brought out

and they expect you to be done after

that standing ovations but then you like

wait a minute and then I have this this

little action figure and it's like okay

cool some more claps but you didn't need

to show us a second one we liked the

first one better

it just seemed unnecessary they should

have ended it at a certain point but

they kept going it's not the biggest

deal in the world you know the movie was

so good that they ended it twice or gave

you two endings basically but it just

really was to the detriment of the

overall ending because I thought they

had a great spot to stop and they just

didn't they just kept taking a bow it's

not horrible it's even with all that

it's still not bad or anything like that

just unnecessary another complaint that

I had about the movie is although the

plot does get pretty convoluted it's

also extremely predictable it's nothing

very new in the crime genre or gangster

genre or anything like that it follows

like a very formulaic plot that I'm

pretty sure the majority of people will

put

gather within the first 40 minutes you

can probably guess where it's going to

eventually lead which I feel is it's a

bit disappointing because when it does

get to that really messy stage there's a

lot of moving parts that really could

have led to a very different outcome and

maybe throw in a bunch of different

loops at you but ultimately it ends the

way you expect it to given what you are

on screen which I feel was just a bit

underwhelming and a little disappointing

but it still is satisfying it doesn't

need to fucking reinvent the genre or

anything it was still satisfying to see

that kind of story play out especially

with the characters here so I'm not

overly this overly disappointed it's

just I feel like there could have been

more that they did with it to not be you

know in that same formulaic wheelhouse

there but overall I enjoyed the movie

let's plug it into the moist meter I'm

giving the gentleman a nice eighty-five

percent I think the movie from top to

bottom was just an enjoyable one with a

couple of flaws for sure but just a very

solid movie with a great cast that put

on a really solid performance really

enjoyable and I actually found it to be

one of the most comedic movies like

actually good comedies of the last year

or so like to all of 2019 till now most

of the comedies have sucked fuck but

this one was pretty solid and it wasn't

even like a primarily comedic movie he

just had some great one-liners in there

and some great back-and-forth so that

was really surprising to me I enjoyed it

a lot as you're no doubt aware I have a

penis and that penis has some balls and

I'm a pretty hairy man so there's often

a lot of hair down there and that

stream's I've talked about the

uncomfortable trimming situations that

I've had but luckily that shit's in the

past thanks to manscape manscaped had an

engineering team spent 18 months in the

ball grooming nutsack trimming facility

the laboratory coming up with the

ultimate design and finally they've

released the lawnmower 3.0 the new gold

standard in male grooming technology

this bad boys got a 7000 rpm motor

battery life of up to 90 minutes if

you've really got to tackle a war zone

down there an LED that illuminates the

grooming areas for precision grooming

it's as high tech as it gets it's

fucking incredible

and the best part it

skin-safe technology so you're never

accidentally cutting yourself down there

Moist Meter | Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot

this episode was brought to you by keeps

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're looking at Dragonball

Z Kakarot this is the latest Dragonball

Z game and like almost every other

Dragonball Z game before it you play

through the story of Dragon Ball Z from

start to finish

however Dragon Ball Z Kakarot is far

more in-depth and has significantly more

fanservice than any of the other ones

which is great they're bringing back

characters that I guarantee no one in

the world remembers ever existed in the

universe in the first place not even

Akira Toriyama would recognize half the

fucking cast and crew here they'll have

like a side quest given to you by the

Baker who appeared in a single scene

during a flashback of episode 8 in the

original Dragon Ball series from the 80s

it's crazy the kind of characters they

brought in here and it's really

heartwarming to see a lot of them

brought back but I don't think they're

side quests they give you are all that

enjoyable most of them are just fetch

quest hey Goku it's good to see you

after 40 years can you find me some

fresh deer meat three tissue boxes and a

lawnmower I'm working on a new invention

this is the quest themselves aren't very

fun from a gameplay perspective but it's

really cute to do them and then get that

character's soul emblem I just basically

like a little trading card with the

character's face on it a little token

with their face on it I'll get into that

in a minute the sole emblem mechanic and

the community board I think is a really

cool interesting mechanic they brought

in but yeah it's not just bringing in

fanservice characters they bring in

literally every element from Dragon Ball

Z's main story arcs even the filler

episodes such as Goku and piccolo

driving it's here it is a really deep

dive through the entire arcs with all of

the fat trimmed off it it's a really

nice summary of everything and it's

really enjoyable to just sit through and

rewatch it again kind of like even just

not playing the game watching it is a

lot of fun because you get all the same

story elements all the same cheesy

dialogue cheesy writing and power-ups

and shit you know I was so fucking

invested in this by the time I was able

to gather the seven Dragon Balls in the

open-world I damn near made it wish

myself four extra inches to my height I

just got so invested in the story in the

game it was cute I felt like a little

kid again going through all this

nostalgia

and I will say if you're not a fan of

Dragon Ball Z I don't think there's a

whole lot here for you in terms of this

story and everything most people are

just gonna find it overly cheesy and

just silly but for fans of the series

it's exactly what you want from a

Dragonball Z story it covers everything

it doesn't leave anything out except for

a couple of trivial things and a couple

of small changes it's just great I

really like what they've done with the

narrative and it's a lot there's a ton

of cutscenes here and I don't think all

the cutscenes look very good a lot of

them they're kind of jump force esque

like jump force meets PowerPoint it's

just very still image shit which is a

little underwhelming but it's it's fun I

do enjoy it like come on how can you not

love these fucking grown men constantly

trying to make each other angry to power

themselves up like Goku you're not angry

enough get angrier come on Gohan that's

not nearly angry enough you fucking

kidding me you look like a pussy out

there not angry think about that time

you saw an opinion on Twitter you didn't

agree with remember how mad you were

then get that mad now to defeat shell

guru come on it's fucking awesome it's

so great and that's definitely my

favorite part is just reliving all the

Dragon Ball Z nostalgia because I

haven't seen all of the arcs since I was

fucking 11 years old now it's been a

long time and it was a really nice

refresher on all of it and I know it's

not unique to Dragon Ball Z games of

course because all of them cover the

exact same shit and all hit the same

beats but Kakarot I think does it the

best by just getting everything in it so

yeah definitely probably the strongest

part of this game the gameplay I don't

think is anything overly different from

what you're used to from Dragon Ball

fighting games except for a fighter Z of

course it's exactly what you're

expecting a lot of spamming be timing

dodging you know Instant Transmission

behind someone a whole bunch of the same

old same old which isn't a problem

because it's the tried-and-true formula

for Dragon Ball fighting games you know

what to expect you get pretty much the

exact thing you're expecting they have a

super ability level up deal where you

collect orbs in the world or through

battle or through the story and you're

able to upgrade your different attacks

different supers getting new abilities

and new bonuses that you stack on your

characters so you can switch things out

change things around but the gameplay at

its core is exactly what you're

expecting from a Dragonball Z fighting

game now one new mechanic that I

mentioned a moment ago that I really

like is the whole soul emblem and

community board the community board is

something and they brought in here where

there's different categories where all

of your soul emblems can fit into for

example every main character as a Soul

emblem Goku all of them and they each

come with different values for each

different category they can be in like Z

fighter training they all have different

numbers and you put these soul emblems

in the board and as you match other

characters in the soul and the community

board you get bonuses you know some

bonuses give you bonus xp some give you

more damage all kinds of different

bonuses that you're able to unlock by

putting new soul emblems in there that

you get from the story or through the

side missions and I think that's a lot

of fun to keep amping up your power

making yourself more powerful making the

grind easier you know maybe you want to

collect more items in the world or get

more money well then you'd overload some

of those categories that give you those

bonuses with some soul emblems that fit

there and then you can give them gifts

that increase it further I just found

that system to be very nice and just

kind of a cute little twist I was able

to just amp the gameplay up a little bit

more for me and add a little bit of

strategy and preparation now the open

world is something that I know a lot of

people are curious about I don't think

the open world really adds all that much

to this game it's kind of just barren

there's not a whole lot to do there's

side quests and they're sure but I mean

I don't think there's anyone that's

gonna go wild over the fishing mechanics

you can do in the open world or you just

slap a fucking butt plug in your asses

Goku and dangle that shit in the river

and wait for a fish to bite then you

bring it up and kick it down it's not

overly fun to fish hunting is equally as

unfun where you just go around sticking

your whole entire fist up a deer's

asshole to get its meat there's also

dinosaurs that you ki blast and then you

get dinosaur meat I don't think anything

the open world has is overly enjoyable

the random encounters and the villain

encounters aren't very fun either he's

just the same repeating three or four

enemies so you just keep fighting the

same shit in the open world and getting

many very trivial rewards from it so

it's never worth the investment and they

also have these orbs floating around

every area so you can collect all of

these orbs and

apples and onions but that's not exactly

what I give a fuck about in Dragon Balls

collecting apples and onions I just want

to be beating some ass and getting a

goofy story so it's just I don't think

the open world is all that great it is

big there's a lot to explore there is a

ton of shit in the open world and there

is a lot of side characters of course

scattered throughout it but it's just

not it's not very fun to just go around

doing the hunting and fishing and shit

like that there's just not a whole lot

of value there but if you want to talk

about pier size of it it is impressive

with how big it is I wasn't expecting

that now the game will take you anywhere

from 30 to 40 hours to complete it took

me just under 30 hours to beat it from

start to finish and that was without

doing all the side quests I did a ton of

them because I got kind of addicted to

getting soul in blooms so I'd bring like

the ginyu force back with a dragon ball

which just to get their soul emblems

which was fucking tedious as shit but

just doing this you know all the side

quests and everything like hundred

presenting this game I could absolutely

see it take anywhere from 40 to 60 hours

there's a lot of content in the game but

I don't think all of its good I know

everyone always likes to you know brag

about how long a game is playtime is you

know $60 and you get 50 hours worth of

entertainment out of it it's great but I

don't agree with that I don't think

that's a good selling point yeah you get

50 hours but are all 50 hours good I'd

rather have a $60 game that's eight

hours long but all eight hours are great

as opposed to a 50 hour game where

twelve hours are great and then all the

rest fucking sucks and is tedious and is

just padding for time that's kind of how

I feel with Dragon Ball Z Kakarot a lot

of even the main story missions are just

fetch quests hey Goku and we're in the

middle of a filler arc so do you mind

going and getting some meteorite that

crashed in the middle of you know the

fucking Cell Games arena somewhere over

there oh yeah just use your senses

you'll find it it'll be fun bringing

back that it's boring missions and again

most of the side missions are boring too

that are fetch missions it's just I

don't think there's a whole lot of value

in the game's length when it's mainly

padding from a lot of the missions now

not all the story missions are fetch

missions in fact I'd argue less than

half hour but there definitely are too

many I'd say the majority of the

missions you're either you're gonna get

an immediate fight or immediately going

out to fetch some shit also I'd like to

say half of the side missions in terms

of their ex

we are totally fucking worthless in

comparison to the story missions for a

single story mission you can get three

million xp for a single side mission you

get like 3k that's it towards the end of

the game but that's the difference

between a side mission and a story

mission you get so much more XP doing

story missions than you do side missions

so if you're trying to level up the last

thing you're gonna want to do is go

around fucking fetching shit for 3,000

XP but you do get some good items from

them which could be worthwhile if you

want to get your community board shit up

but I mean the XP difference is

remarkable plugging this into the moist

meter I'm giving Dragon Ball Z Kakarot a

nice 65 percent well I do love the story

in all of its cheesy goofy goodness if

you're not a fan of Dragonball already

there is absolutely nothing for you

there I imagine most people get turned

off by it and I also do like the

gameplay but it gets extremely tedious

and it really is the same fight over and

over and over again there's really

nothing too innovative or new about the

combat system not that it totally needs

to reinvent it but just something to

kind of make it a little fresher

I guess they kind of tried they'll have

these like bullet health sections where

a boss enemy has a special attack but

even that that's just one quick thing

that lasts ten seconds that's nothing

overly great so the gameplay does get

super samey and tedious after a little

while and just boring and uninteresting

at points but I enjoyed the game overall

I'd say it was a lot of fun I do think

the side missions as well really all the

missions that involve fetch quests

really needed to be addressed it a

little bit better it seems like it just

really wanted a pad out to play time

without any real justification for

getting those items or any real story

significance behind it just seemed like

for the sake of making it long overall

though good game had fun with it Jackson

Moist Meter | Bad Boys for Life

this episode is brought to you by Ray

Khan it's been 17 years since the last

bad boys movie and I think I can say

with a high degree of confidence that

another bad boys movie hasn't exactly

been on the top of everyone's wishlist I

don't think there's been many people

during that 17 years fuckin scratching

at their neck begging for their fix of

more bad boys content now that's not to

say that the first two movies and the

bad boys universe were bad or anything

because they certainly weren't I enjoyed

them and I can vividly remember the

intense gore from the second movie

blowing the mind of a nine-year-old

Charlie I didn't even know bodies could

explode and be gored the way they were

in that movie but again I think it all

wrapped itself up just fine I don't

think during that 17 years there are

people with blue balls just waiting for

more but I'm happy to say that the more

they gave us bad boys for life is good

it's a good movie now it doesn't live up

to the original two but it didn't really

have a chance to it's been 17 years in

between obviously they weren't gonna be

able to carry any of that momentum from

back then and hit those same marks and

they didn't bring Michael Bay back so it

didn't have the same power behind it

that it originally had but it's a good

movie but it does have a lot of problems

I'll get into that in a moment but the

things I like about it

Will Smith and Martin Lawrence I think

they still absolutely fucking crush it

in their roles here and I think they

still have some great on-screen

chemistry and they play off each other

really well and it's a fun dynamic well

I don't feel the majority of the jokes

landed the ones that did were pretty

solid jokes especially during the

airplane section I thought almost all of

those jokes they threw out there landed

pretty well but there were quite a few

that just kind of made you roll your

eyes but you kind of expect that because

this movie really seemed to want to play

it safe it kind of was like a watered

down bad boys as if it was a group of

fans of the originals that wanted to

make one but the network said tone it

down we want to make it safe so they did

and I feel like that's a bit of a missed

opportunity they also have a really odd

narrative where they try and throw in

these bafflingly silly decisions towards

the end that don't really make a whole

lot of sense from a plot perspective and

it just kind of seems like a bit of a

about but it's not in any way

offensively bad or anything it's nothing

that makes you regret going to see it as

far as action-movie goes it's very solid

there's a lot of really good set pieces

a lot of good chaos a lot of good blood

and bullets and lead and all of it just

lends itself well to being a decent

action movie but in between these set

pieces there's just a lot of dead space

it just feels like a lot of stuff that

isn't interesting to watch it isn't

really enjoyable to have these side

characters that come on that aren't good

there's a new division called ammo

that's aiming to replace the bad boys in

their old school style of tits rock and

roll and gore they do it more tactically

using technology the evil technology

they even mentioned 4chan in here so

even mr. fortunes coming out to play and

I just feel like those characters in

ammo just weren't very good characters

there's one guy that's just an asshole

for no reason one of the major plot

points is Mike gets shot and he goes out

for revenge

so Mike comes back after getting shot

and the guy's just a fucking asshole to

him he's like oh I'm Mikey you're

looking good for getting shot you're a

little pussy for no reason and then two

scenes later he's fist bumping Mike and

then they're like the best of Bros he's

like I fucked your mom yeah you fucked

my mom right Mike Pitt fist-bump on

fucking my mom it just seems out of

nowhere like there's at no point do they

ever feel like friends until all of a

sudden they're like inseparable out of

nowhere there's never any build-up they

never really develop a relationship just

one second this dudes a douchebag next

second they're basically going out and

slaying pussy together there's they're

just not good characters they don't add

anything

they're very two-dimensional but towards

the end they have some great moments and

they're action scenes there's one tech

guy who's like a super buff man and at

the end of the movie just goes fucking

Hulk mode which is goofy and cool but

you know it's it's enjoyable at no point

is the movie ever not enjoyable I just

feel like in between their big set

pieces and explosions and chaos it just

it just drags it just has these weak

characters that are trying to do

something different but it just ends up

being the most generic shit ever that

you've seen a million times it tells the

same story that you've seen a million

times until it tries to throw something

different that just is

it's it's just a lot of things that are

both very generic and then in an effort

to not be super generic just gets very

silly which isn't the worst thing in the

world it's still a good movie it just

has quite a few problems I also think

the soundtrack in here the score isn't

nearly as enjoyable as it was in the

original movies it feels like the safest

possible music they could have possibly

put in this movie which I feel is a bit

of a letdown because that kind of shit

in the old movies would get you hype I

felt like this going into this I felt

like I'd try and be like an old-school

late 90s early 2000s gorefest

just full of thrills type action movie

but it's not there is gore there is

action there is a decent bit of it but

it's not capturing that same spirit and

that's not not the worst thing in the

world because it is still good when it

does break out the big guns and go wild

I just feel like it could have been a

lot more for the bad boys were a union

here and there it seems like they're

setting up for more bad boys I don't

know why but I mean if they can get back

to the original 2 & 1 and even some of

what they did in 3 if they could just

mix all of them together bad boys 4

would be a great fucking action movie

and that's not to say this one wasn't

because I did enjoy it

plugging it into the moist meter I'm

giving bad boys for life a nice 60% I

don't think anyone's gonna be overly

disappointed if you're hardcore bad boys

fan if such a thing exists you will

probably be pleased if you're a fan

action movies you'll probably be pleased

but it's not a memorable action movie or

experience it's just a fun one for about

two hours that you're gonna enjoy and

that's about it I actually just got back

from the gym after bumping some boner

jams through the old ray cons here and

throwing up the heaviest weight in the

entire iron temple as you'd expect from

me with the strength that rivals

Hercules and I wanted to tell you about

ray Khan as I've done in the past I

really like Ray Khan especially at the

gym and just not just at the gym but

being active having wireless earbuds is

just such a huge benefit even just

getting into the car and getting around

is much more convenient having used

wired headphones for my whole life like

a fucking caveman getting that shit

stuck on something and ripped out as

unpleasant you don't have to worry about

that with Ray Khan there's fit secure

they sound just as good as the other

premium audio brands but start at half

the price it's just a great

product and a great deal and I can't

recommend them enough especially if

you're going to be active out there at

the gym or just doing day-to-day shit

and you want to hear some boner jams so

if you're interested you can pick up a

pair of these bad boys at by rakin comm

slash moist again that's by rakin comm

slash moist that's it so yeah

Moist Meter | 1917

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're looking at 1917 I'll

go ahead and get this out of the way now

and confess a sin I've been extremely

tired of war movies for like a decade

now the only one I've liked really like

quite a bit in the last decade was

Dunkirk but other than that I just feei

felt like there's just not a whole lot

more to do with war movies it's kind of

like war video games you know world war

two was a trend for shooters for a while

now it's just fucking stale and tiresome

that's how I felt about war movies for a

while I feel like every story they want

to tell everything they want to do with

it has been done before until 1917 I

didn't know anything about this movie

going into it and I was blown away by it

it is a technical marvel the movie is

designed to look like it's all done in

one single take just one shot one camera

one erection one time across an entire

adventure across the whole battlefield

and it pulls it off beautifully there's

obviously some cuts in here it's not

actually all done in one take but if you

weren't paying attention you wouldn't

know that because it's pulled off so

well the only times you know it cuts is

when it goes to darkness for a little

while or if it goes by the giant fucking

rock or you know a CGI element or

something you can tell that it does cut

there but you have to be paying very

close attention to pick up on that and

there's no it's not like there's a

benefit to knowing it cuts you know on

aha moment Eureka you cut right there

you fooled me the illusions broken this

isn't real I equipped I fucking hate it

I want a refund there's no reason to

care that much about the cuts when it's

pulled off this well because it's so

smooth and it really does convince you

that it's genuinely all done in a single

take it's amazing and some of the shots

they have here it's just mind-blowing I

got I don't know how they did half of

them there's a certain scene where

they're going around this fucking small

disgusting looking pond that looks like

raw sewage I a septic tank just fucking

exploded with those bodies in there it's

carnage and they have the camera

following them until they go around the

outside and instead of taking the easy

shot where it just follows them around

the outside it goes across the water at

almost the same level as the bodies so

you see these bodies you see them

walking around behind them and you see

the water and it's a really beautiful

shot that I genuinely have no

idea how they could possibly pull off

like that and there's no ripples in the

water or anything like that it's

continually impressive an absolute

technical marvel like I said it's super

super good from that perspective and I

absolutely loved it a truly unique movie

that I had no idea I'd be getting from

this there's only a couple complaints

that have about the movie at all really

I think the movie is just incredibly

well done

there's especially the acting the acting

in this movie is incredible the two

leads I've never seen them before but my

god they were incredible it's a story

about two soldiers that are given a very

important mission to deliver a message

to a different area about an attack and

trying to stop a bunch of soldiers from

dying and one of the soldiers brothers

is there so it's it's an emotional

journey and it spans a lot of different

areas and a lot of shit going wrong it's

really really tense and they pulled that

off really nicely because you never feel

like the characters are safe either

walking through an open field you feel

like at any moment now the fucking

Underminer from Incredibles is gonna

come up and just slaughter them or

something because they're in constant

peril they go through you know some

underground areas they might hit a trip

mine and you know all get fucked up

there's fucking dogfight going on in the

air and who knows maybe the plane will

crash down upon them it's always at any

moment they could die and it's

incredible how tense that is in a movie

that shot this way where you're

following behind them to the point where

you feel like you're in their little

group like you're the third member the

bench player that no one really pays

attention to it's really cool and a

really unique experience the only two

complaints I have is there's a few

cliches and slow scenes in this movie

that I don't think contribute to

anything at all there's one part in

particular that I didn't care for even a

little bit it's when one of the I don't

want to spoil anything but they come

across this area that's got a lot of

shit going wrong and conveniently they

find like one of the only people still

left in the area and then they go into

this weird cliche thing and I just

didn't like what they did with it I

didn't think it had any purpose it

didn't do anything for any of the

characters it didn't do anything for the

tone of the movie I just thought it

seemed very out of place I'm fine with a

movie being slow then this movie is more

about building the tension and the

emotion behind the journey but some of

these scenes like that one in particular

I felt just didn't fit and just seemed

unnecessary but other than that I think

everything else worked beautifully there

isn't a whole ton of you know bullets

and blood and gore flying all over the

place at least not until towards the end

of the movie but that doesn't matter

because it still shows you a lot of

disturbing things there's a lot of gross

shit that shows you the horrors of the

battlefield without ever having any

bullets fly you have just dirty shit all

over the place one of the two men cuts

themselves and then they fall into a

corpse and open wound and goes right

into a corpses fucking blasted open

chest it's yucky it's some real icky

shit and it does a great job of setting

the tone and I think that's really great

how they pulled that off instead of

going with the standard war approach

where it's all about like bullets and

shit flying and limbs going all over the

place this takes a very different

approach to that because all that's

already happened before their journey

and now they're going through the

battlefield after it's happened until

they get to some other places down the

line in the movie and I really enjoyed

that a lot the only other thing I had a

bit of an issue with aside from a couple

of out of play scenes is they didn't do

anything to build the two characters

that you follow the it is an emotional

journey and there definitely are

emotional moments but you don't know

anything about the characters you don't

get very much about them as soldiers or

people or anything they're just kind of

they almost kind of like just objects to

get this technical achievement done

they're not really given enough detail

enough care to make you really invested

in them as characters you only really

care about them because you want to keep

seeing more of what they're about to go

through at any I don't think at any

point you ever really bond with the

characters or feel any sort of

attachment to them but again there are

emotional moments that work it's just I

feel like they could have done a lot

more to really bring these characters

more life and I think that's just a bit

of a missed opportunity because it could

have I think it could have been very

easy for them to do in this movie

especially given some of the stuff that

happens but they just don't they just

keep them moving from basically one

booby-trap home alone style to the next

one and all this danger which is great

but it would have been nice to care more

about the characters and get a little

more from them but overall I really

think everything

in this movie hits and it hits fucking

hard it does a great job they have this

incredible soundtrack the score that

comes on and this crescendo that builds

the tensions building running through

this fucking decrepit little area with

flares going off it's really a cinematic

technical masterpiece and I really

enjoyed it so let's plug the shit into

the moist meter I'm giving 1917 a crisp

90 % also I just did this whole fucking

thing in one take I usually do but

sometimes it takes more than one I

thought in the spirit of 1917 to give a

little nod to Sam Mendes and the crew

I'd do the whole moist meter in a single

take and hopefully I swear I didn't cut

on purpose I got a phone call which is

why the the video cut there it wasn't a

planned cut so god damn it that was just

such unfortunate timing but anyway just

all done in one take as a nod to the

director Sandman does a great movie

though 1917 is a fucking banger that's

about it yeah

Moist Meter | Vinland Saga

initiating moisture fucking year for

anime welcome to the moist meter we're

looking at another anime Vinland saga

this is an Amazon exclusive one and it

absolutely slaps it is again another

great anime to finish off 2019 it's the

story of a Viking on a quest for revenge

and he travels along with the man who

killed his father hoping to kill him at

some point and it's a lot deeper than

that but that's the gist of it it is

such a well-written show with perhaps

one of the best villains in all of anime

and it could even be argued that the

main villain isn't even a villain so ask

a lad is who I'm talking about and he is

just beautifully written an incredible

character he's at sometimes your comical

mustache twirling I will behead you for

the sake of entertainment hahaha kind of

villain but and then other times they

gave him so much depth to give context

to that side of him and it's just really

impressive what they've done with that

character thor finn is arguably the

protagonist but it's hard to say because

i also could say asked aloud is the

actual protagonist of the season it's

just a really great dynamic between thor

finn and ask aloud and I think both

characters are really really strong

especially ask allowed the whole season

I was worried it would drag but at no

point does the season ever drag there is

a lot of action but there's also a lot

of just characters scheming talking you

getting to know the characters their

environment their time period their

morals their ideals it's a lot of actual

character development and depth as

opposed to just Vikings rippin tits off

and slicing cock it is a lot a lot more

than I expected and I also want to point

this out this is the first anime I've

ever seen where I never skipped the

intro at least in the first one survived

said the Prophet did the intro for the

first part of the season and it's such a

banger that song absolutely bangs I

never skipped it was so good I didn't

care for the second song they used in

the second half

so I started skipping it thin but when

they were using survived said the

Prophet I was fucking bumping my fist to

that shit every time it was just a

really really great show and I really

enjoyed it the animation was top-notch

when there was a fight it was really

well animated I didn't think at any

point that it felt cheap there wasn't

any times where it was you know a still

image with a moving camera like one

punch man season 2 or some shit it was

it was really felt very full of passion

and like they wanted to come out here

and make something memorable and I think

they absolutely did I think Vinland saga

is one of the strongest of the season

it's hard for me to say if it's the best

of the year because I really really like

dr. stone and the new attack on Titan

was great too I don't know it's just a

really really great show that I highly

recommend and this is one of those that

I'd recommend to people that don't like

anime it has great gory action with

actual cool choreography in it it has

great character development and writing

across the board sometimes it has some

really goofy anime tropes but I don't

think it's that big of a deal and

especially with how scarce they are in

this it's just really really enjoyable I

have nothing but compliments for Vinland

saga that being said I don't think it's

like the best show ever made but it's

definitely one of the best of this year

it is really enjoyable so plugging

Vinland saga in to the moist meter I'm

giving this bad boy a fat 90% again the

only reason I wouldn't give it a 95

percent I'm gonna go ahead and justify

that is because I can see why people

would maybe lose interest in the

historical aspect that they try and

capture at some points because again a

lot of it is like there's this priest

who just likes to get drunk and talk

about love I can see some people getting

very turned off by that so I can

definitely see some negatives some would

have I didn't have any personally but

looking at it through other perspectives

I can definitely see some parts of this

dragon for some people because there is

like three episodes of just straight

walking across some terrain and

characters talking about love and what

it means to be a warrior and to some

people that's not the most entertaining

thing in the world but I think it is an

extremely strong show that I enjoyed

from start to finish and I kept waiting

week by week to see what the next you

know unveiling in the show

there's also a character Thor Kell who

has a lot of depth that you don't expect

cuz when in the beginning he's just this

giant fucking monster man that just

seems devoid of all intelligence but by

the end of the season you see a lot of

different sides of him and he is a lot

more than meets the eye

great show that's about it so yeah

The Worst 5 Games of 2019

initiating moisture ladies and gentlemen

welcome back to the moist these Ryan

Seacrest wasn't available to host so I'm

here instead it's me Charlie

the ultimate greasy gamer the super

supreme specimen of ultimate gaming

barbarism and think about this a mere

fifty years ago the idea of a gamer

didn't even exist

the closest thing you had to gamers were

the people in your elementary school

that didn't get cholera during the

Oregon Trail game and now look how far

we've come today we're looking at the

shittiest games of 2019 kicking us off

with a semi chub we've got WWE 2k 20

taking the fifth spot now this isn't

something I'd normally do a sports game

as one of the worst games I fucking hate

sports games you already know that I'm

not out there fucking limp dick and hand

playing Fifa constantly or any sports

game really but WWE 2k 20 is a special

exception this game switched studios

from previous WWE games and it shows

it's bad from top to bottom the game

almost doesn't work without bugs you

can't have a single match go down

without some type of catastrophic and

jarring glitch the story mode is one of

the most laughable things in all of

campaign history you plays like these

two up-and-coming wrestlers that are

both just really shit characters on this

really bad adventure that's poorly

animated half the female hair choices

come out stiffer than a goddamn uncooked

spaghetti noodle when there's when

they're twirling their hair around it

looks like they're twirling around pure

blocks of Steel there's no fluidity to

it so it's all real goofy looking but in

the story mode specifically that really

shines cuz you spend a lot more time

looking at these characters and they're

moving around a lot and the story's

really juvenile like they get into a

little wrestling match at school one

time because they were looking at

wrestling notes in their notebook and

then some important ketchup on a girl

it's dumb it's a dumb game it's story

mode super fucking dumb but the thing

that makes it so significantly worse

than the other entries is just how unfun

it is to play unresponsive in just

impossible

to play without encountering bugs and

game altering glitches it's a game that

clearly was rushed there's no actual

effort behind it half of the things here

seem to be like placeholders waiting for

an actual fucking texture or model to go

in with actual animation it's rough it's

super rough and it definitely shouldn't

have shipped it should have waited been

cooking in the oven for at least another

five or six months

number four left alive aka almost Metal

Gear Solid aka please compare us to

Metal Gear Solid so we can sell a few

copies even their box art tries

extremely hard to look like Metal Gear

Solid but it's not even close it fucking

sucks this game tries to do so many

things and it's bad at all of them it's

stealth is insulting boring poorly

implemented and doesn't really work very

well especially when it's complimented

by the weirdest AI of 2019 sometimes the

AI troops are totally fucking asleep you

can stand in front of them jerk off

smoke a cigarette hit a fucking gravity

bong and they will not alert but then 30

seconds later they can see the goddamn

future and they will come sprinting

around across the entire zone because I

smelt your fart when you entered and

they all put you down and you will not

expect it the AI is all over the place

it also has these awful mech sections

where it's just you stand around and

spray in like a little area just fucking

fire hose them with bullets it's not fun

the story is garbage and the voice

acting is laughable the voice acting

sounds like everyone tried to beat Tommy

was oh if Tommy was Oh was overdosing on

xanax the voice acting is just so

uninspired lazy and bad I don't even

know how you find voice acting this bad

in these in this day and age when

everyone wants to do things like this

and people are good at it it's hard you

have to go out of your way to find

shitty voice acting like this lab

they've done it they managed to get this

entire package of garbage the whole

thing is just bad start to finish it

doesn't even run well shits choppy as

shit half the time and it's not like

it's because it's graphically impressive

because it's not shit looks dated like

2006 style visuals it's bad bad game I

don't think many of you have even heard

of left alive it's one of those games

that went really under the radar for

obvious reasons even them trying to

piggyback off of Metal Gear didn't work

the

no one gave a shit so yeah it's bad

though moving on to number three we have

crackdown 3 a game with years and years

of hype in the making I still remember

how excited I was for crackdown 3 I

loved the first two first one more than

the second but I still liked it I was so

excited for crackdown 3 especially when

they had that tech demo of shit falling

down blowing up tits flying all over the

place with this real-time cloud rendered

explosive destruction real-time physics

tittie physics that wasn't in the

preview with the titty physics but you

get the idea they had these crazy

physics going on and I love Red Faction

gorilla which is still so innovative and

holds up well by the way

and I thought crackdown 3 was gonna be

on par if not better than that with all

these like really my new details they

paid attention to when they were

destroying buildings in the tech demo I

was hypest shit I think most people were

and then a year goes by and nothing's

really coming from it another year goes

by still nothing's come from it and then

these it's eventually people just

thought it was a cancelled project just

fuckin candidate flush it down the

toilet but then to everyone's surprise

it actually comes out and everyone

wished it didn't it would have been

significantly better if it just remained

a myth that never came to fruition

because what ended up being crackdown 3

is the lamest board most boring generic

can't even say generic because it's so

fucking bad it can't be generic just

uninspired garbage it the whole game

looks and plays like a Unity tech demo

from an indie studio on Steam when

they're trying to squeeze some money out

of early access so they haphazardly

throw something together the games bad

it is super bad and it feels looks and

plays unfinished and just not what you'd

expect from something with that much

hype that much time in the oven and in

2019 it's an unforgivably bad experience

in game there is so little to like about

crackdown 3 it's just it's not good

which is why it's number 3 number 2 goes

to contra rogue core contra is a

franchise and a name that used to just

elicit such a masculine response you

know you say contra and fucking hairs

pop up on your chest it was a really

powerful franchise and really

influential for its time

nowadays the only response that elicits

is fucking projectile vomit or diarrhea

contra rogue core is truly horrid it's a

twin stick shooter completely redoing

the contra formula which was which isn't

a sin in and of itself but doing it as

poorly as this game does absolutely is

it's not a fun twin stick shooter and it

has this overheating thing where contra

was built on running and gunning just

constant fucking bullets hail of bullets

you know eating lead and spitting tits

in contra Road core you can't do that

because everything overheats so you have

to constantly stop shooting and waiting

which is super anti fun and really goes

against like the core design element of

contra in and of itself it is in

bafflingly bad decision the story is

just so poorly written the lines the

one-liners the comedy all of it is so

poorly written and seems just so lazy it

really feels like the entire game is

rushed to meet a deadline and it shows

that more in its like actual levels

because entire levels are just copy and

pasted you'll play one level and then

you know one hour later you're playing

that exact same level with no changes at

all the objectives are always repeated

it's just there's no diversity in the

game it's the same game from the fucking

tutorial till the end of the game

nothing changes nothing is ever fun it

is so boring it is so lazy and it really

feels super unfinished porn parodies are

more respectable to the source material

than contra rogue core is to the Contra

name it's just fucking terrible and I

can't believe that it's a 20-19 game

because it's a console game and it looks

like a phone game you would have played

five years ago it's bad it's really bad

what is the number one shittiest game of

the year we're at the number one spot

the cream of the crop the champion who

takes home the shittiest game of the

Year award from the moist ease I'm sure

hundred million gamers all at once knew

the answer and they all pumped their

fists in the air and they said anthem

because anthem is the shittiest game of

2019 and it is a pleasure to say that

because the beta didn't work and at the

time Jackson and I were joking around

about how bad the beta was so we made

the anthem his awful series and the

fucking Bioware fanboys and anthem in

Susy is fuckin brainwashed zombies we're

all saying it's just a beta are you guys

fucking dumb the game can be so much

better than this beta obviously it's

just a beta you don't get it then the

full game comes out and it's even worse

than the beta and the game dies within

like three weeks

the developers abandon it within two

months you get fuckin radio silence no

fixes the game in a broken state

horrible looting system horrible systems

all across the board shitty game from

top to bottom nothing is working the way

it was supposed to fans going up in

flames the subreddit which was once a

safe haven for fans turns into this hate

haven oh it was nuts there was like a

fucking war a videogame or war in the

anthem battlefield and I have to be

honest it was a pleasure to see that

because this blind fucking fanboy ISM

this hail corporate shit where you just

digest product because you like product

and you never want to hear criticism

about product I think is so detrimental

to things getting better they out the

subreddit at the time of the beta in its

early launch outright just deleted

things that were negative about the game

to foster this idea that the game was

perfect and that is the worst practice

possible you need criticism of something

even things you like you don't need to

just constantly say product want more

product I love Bioware so I have to love

everything Bioware that's not that's not

good that's not how you get better games

than how you improved the game you're

playing the game was in a broken state

the end game not fun even to a certain

extent non fucking existent they had

these weird fucking it's so much to go

into but these weird grinding mechanics

that didn't pan out well so when you did

finally reach the end game it didn't

feel rewarding this starter gun was

scaled the same as the best gun in the

game at one point so like literally one

of the first things you start with would

be doing the same if not more damage is

something you'd spend a hundred hours

getting there was so much wrong with

that game and it stayed wrong for that

game and then they eventually totally

outright abandoned it silence the

community shunned them it's a relic of

the past existing only in wet nightmares

of those that experienced it still

reddit warriors on the anthem some

reddit trembling remembering those days

in the trenches fighting them either

positive or negative comments depending

on whose side you were on it was nuts

anthem was a game that totally redefined

what it meant to have a shitty launch

anthem

like the WWE 2k 20 of shooting games it

is a big non-functional shitty shooter

stinker bad just all of the adjectives

you could use to describe something

abhorrent anthem epitomized it was

insufferable and well I can't say that

it's overly surprising the most of you

because I'm sure you saw anthem coming

never before by seeing a Triple A game

and a studio with as much street cred

and as much renowned as Bioware have a

game this bad B this poorly received and

totally just washed their hands of it

and delete it that was crazy that was a

fucking Power Move and something I'd

never seen before

so anthem absolutely shittiest game of

2019 earning that prestigious award from

the moist ease thanks everyone for

tuning in and that's it

so yeah

The Best 5 Games of 2019

initiating moisture ladies and gentlemen

welcome back to the moist ease

unfortunately Jack Black wasn't

available to host so instead it's me

Charlie and today we're looking at the

five best games of 2019 now I know the

moist meter has become synonymous with

real tough grading like that fucking

teacher that'll beat your ass and give

you enough because he didn't put up a

fight but there is a lot of games and a

lot of movies as well that we find to be

truly extraordinary we're tough because

we want things to be good and we want

them to improve so let's hit it and shit

it number five outer wilds outer wilds

is like no other game out there it is

truly by all definitions a unique game

that's a title that gets tossed around a

lot but outer wilds absolutely deserves

that nomenclature because outer wilds

does what pretty much no other game does

fucking challenge is the player to

constantly be thinking it's a game where

the core mechanic involves getting

yourself totally immersed in a beautiful

system these incredible worlds and

piecing together lore and using that

lore and all the new information that

you find about all these planets who

inhabited them using all of that to

solve puzzles and get your character

progressing in the story and solving the

dilemma that you find yourself in it's a

very slow game that's obviously not

going to be for everyone but if you can

get yourself lost in the universe here

you're going to be rewarded with some

incredible incredible decisions and

decisions being the wrong word

incredible writing decisions that were

made some fucking fantastic lore

beautiful planets that are a joy to

explore and get lost in it never really

gets frustrating to get lost by the way

because it's constantly just feeling

like it's leading to a bigger Eureka

moment where you solve a puzzle or you

use your gamer galaxy brain intelligence

to you know piece together these things

that are happening that you're learning

about and it feels like everything is

just so finely crafted it with such

attention to detail down to the very

last rock like everything has a deeper

meaning you'll start looking at

everything through the eyes of like a

pretentious artist the kind of people

that look at a banana taped to a wall

and say yeah up

hundred fifty grand for that it means

something impressive I'm sure like in

this game if you see six rocks stacked

in a formation that looks like an

alligator that might mean something

potentially like there's just so much

shit to find discover and explore that

it leads itself to just being this

incredible experience outer wild

absolutely deserves the fifth spot on

the list number four we have a game

that's going to surprise a lot of you

and its presence on this list given how

much shit I've talked about it its apex

legends now I've talked a lot of shit

about apex legends and it's because I

love the fucking game so much it was my

favorite FPS game in years but

post-launch they let it stagnate and die

for like the better part of five months

were the only changes they make were one

extra bullet in a magazine somewhere we

removed one tree next to the bunker

to help with balancing issues these

trivial fucking garbage changes and it

just made the game get so stale and

repetitive and just for me just fade out

but it's hard to dishearten I look back

on apex legends positively with the 800

or so hours I put into it in the first

two or three months of its presence in

the battle royale genre apex legends was

a game that came into a genre I was

already getting tired of a genre that

was getting oversaturated and stale and

it fucking came in and it breathed some

new life into it and the developers in

their defense respawn has been putting

more effort into keeping Apex fresh and

updated so I do respect that and they've

been making a lot of recent efforts

there but what I'm saying is initially

it didn't have that but the first three

or so months I was so engrossed in this

game I was playing it constantly I

wanted to be competitive I wanted to be

the best and god damn it I was so

fucking close I'm like your dad's friend

that comes over and tells you about the

time that he almost went to the NFL that

was me with Apex I almost went pro I was

so fucking good at that game

I loved it the fast paced the sliding

the mechanics the movement system the

movement had its own fucking meta in the

proper ways to get around fast the

proper ways to explore the proper ways

to you know peak things the optimal

equipment just so many small things that

made apex great aside from its great

crisp gunplay it was such an

- to be fair it still is a very tight

and fluid fast fun game and let me

clarify I don't think every game needs

to be updated every three days to add

something new or some goofy skin or

emote or some shit like that but in Apex

legends case there was a lot of game

breaking well game breaking being a

little exaggerated Ori there are a lot

of important bugs that weren't addressed

for months and just existed in the game

for a long time the lobbies were really

laggy game would crash it had a lot of

issues that were not addressed and they

let it persist for way too long

that's why it started to stagnate and

die I just wanted to clarify

but apex legends absolutely deserves the

fourth spot on this list moving on to

number three Resident Evil 2 remake

Resident Evil 2 remake redefines

what it means to be a fucking remake

this game reinvented the word for a

while remake or HD remaster meant

fucking nothing it meant maybe they

improved the graphics very minimally or

they improved the look of a single box

in level 4 but when Resident Evil 2

remake came out this is a fucking true

remake this game is visually stunning

it looks fantastic so upgraded so modern

so much fun the game plays super great

and I'm one of the people that wasn't so

personally attached to Resident Evil 2

there's no huge and nostalgia for me I'd

played it but it wasn't the best thing

in the world to me and when I heard

they're remaking it I didn't rip off my

shirt and start twirling it over my head

like I was at it like a goddamn college

football game or something I was

cautiously optimistic it'd be fun but I

was blown away completely stunned by how

much effort went into it and how much I

enjoyed it

the game was spectacular and it makes me

super excited for Resident Evil three

remake now and I don't think I ever

played Resident Evil 3 but anyway great

game can't recommend it enough one of

the most fun games of the year which is

obviously why it's on this list I think

all of the old-school mechanics held up

really well in the modern day made it

challenging made it fun kept you engaged

kept you on your toes and really brought

back that feeling of what it means to

play a game that makes you think and a

game that actually challenges you it was

a really fun experience moving on to

number two the second best game of 2019

Star Wars Jedi fallen order also fun

little trivia fact for those of you

playing fucking jeopardy or something at

home this is the second Respawn

Entertainment game that makes the top 5

best games of the year list really

impressive work from respawn this year

very talented people there Jedi fallen

order bangs this game is incredible not

only is the gameplay extremely fun and

addicting its story was extremely

surprising it was really well written

well-constructed paid very much respect

to the Star Wars property and

established Canon it didn't break any

rules didn't violate shit didn't fuck

any characters in the ass or do anything

crazy it was like what

Star Wars cinematic universe could have

been in terms of its writing should if I

could have Respawn Entertainment write

the new movie this story was a real

highlight and a real shock I was

expecting the gameplay to be mediocre

like Dark Souls mobile I thought it was

just gonna be a Dark Souls inspired

clone that was really light on the

challenge and light on the mechanics but

it wasn't it was clearly inspired by

Dark Souls and sekito

but it made it its own and had its own

unique identity that worked really well

with the forest powers that you could

integrate into the combat and it felt

very very fun rewarding some of the

fights were extremely challenging and I

played on the highest difficulty and

that made it significantly more fun it

was always a absolute blast anytime you

got in a boss battle with another

lightsaber wielder ass if the lightsaber

battles and the boss battles were some

of the highlights of all boss battles I

had this year this shit was visually

beautiful you had these like crazy

choreographed well not choreographed

obviously but you had these crazy moves

going on you do this combo they block it

fucking forced push you throw a rock at

you you dodge it off to the right you

fucking face had so much going on that

was such an orgasm for your eyes to

behold in this arena of force showdown I

loved it I absolutely loved Jedi fallen

order I loved everything about that game

and I would shock to say that because I

didn't think I never liked a Star Wars

game to this level but this was quite

the surprise the number one game of the

year I think it's gonna be a no surprise

to anyone who knows me

it's sekito I love sekito I love Dark

Souls game

I love souls like games Neos my favorite

and sekito is falling into that category

but with its own very unique personality

to it it has a very different mechanical

style the gameplays wildly different

from the other ones it's it's almost in

a certain sense a rhythm game about the

right times to parry blocking when to

strike how many hits to get in there

before you get the fuck out before they

punish you for it and block your shit

and make you feel bad it was just so

nice I also really loved all of the

visuals the setting I thought was just

superb

I'm a sucker for that kind of setting

anyway but they have these really nice

boss battles and set pieces and I just

loved it every single fight had you

going in there on edge because you never

knew how hard they were gonna fuck you

you'd go into a room you'd see a pretty

tall enemy or something you're like yep

I got a clinch my cheeks cuz I don't

want to get fucked that hard I'm down

for a little ass pounding but it needs

to feel respectful and it constantly

happened you were every mini boss

would give you a run for your money

there was no pushovers in this game and

I loved it from start to finish the true

ending final boss the sword Saint was

probably one of the toughest boss

battles I've ever had and that's that's

quite the compliment because I usually

steamrolled these boss battles being the

kind of Alpha Omega gamer that I am I

never really struggle with that kind of

shit but the fucking sword Saint was

eating my lunch he was just ripping my

cock off for like two hours I think it

took me I don't remember now but it was

it was a long one rode hard and put away

wet by the end of that it was just such

a great game and definitely one of the

most memorable games I've played in

years to be honest loved it top to

bottom sekito absolutely deserves the

number one spot thanks for tuning in to

this year's moist ease I'd recommend all

five games on here if you haven't tried

any of them out and then fuck ya the

great game a great year for gaming

overall I think the games were really

great and it was hard to pick five but

these five I think definitely shined the

brightest so yeah that's it everyone

thanks for tuning in to the moist these

best games of 2019 see ya

Moist Meter | The Mandalorian

initiating moisture hello let's address

the elephant in the room right away I'm

not at my place I'm at Tiana's place

which is why there's a poster that says

ohana means family next to me I'm not a

huge lilo and stitch fan but anyway I

just finished the mandalorian and I

wanted to talk about it it's eight

episodes and six of them are very good

episodes four and five were the only two

blemishes on this record it's a really

good show and I really enjoyed the

characters but man I cannot get that the

fucking sensation that taste of just raw

asshole out of my mouth from the fourth

and fifth episode but I guess that's

kind of what to be expected when there's

always different directors coming in for

different episodes but it's not that big

of a deal it's eight episodes and the

only problem I have is that two of them

are shitty fillers which is episodes

four and five and I can't really call

them fillers because they do play a role

at the end of the series it's just it

was jarring to go from three episodes

that are just absolutely great

- then these two stinkers in the middle

and then finish strong

which I guess is the best you can hope

for but with eight episodes you'd expect

all eight to be pretty full-throttle

really giving their best face and two of

them don't do that that's the only

complaint I have I want to get that out

of the way right now I wanted to get

that complaint on the table and move on

to everything I liked about it like most

people I liked baby Yoda I'm extremely

surprised there's not baby Yoda

merchandise that was out for Christmas

like fucking plushies and toilet paper

and cons or anything just to capitalize

on that hysteria of baby Yoda because

everyone fell in love with them as did I

and Jackson it's just a really fun

character that does some really cool

force things and like some goofy moments

and it's just super adorable and super

cute and I like that it's not a CGI baby

Yoda it's a puppet and I think that's

really special I always appreciate

things like that and I think that's why

you can get so attached to them and just

love them so much that you yourself

could see yourself going to war to

protect them I also really like Pedro

Pascal as the Mandalorian the headlining

Mandalorian I think he does a great job

I do think the show in the beginning

doesn't do a good job of showing you how

powerful he is or how strong he is gonna

get his ass beat like 15 times in the

first five episodes and no point does he

ever really show like I am an elite

warrior he's constantly needing help

from baby Yoda he couldn't even fight

these fucking blerg which are just

inflated boomers from left4dead that

walk on all four he couldn't fight them

so he needed help from a deus ex machina

who comes out of nowhere to save them

and then they become friends and that

character ends up being really important

and really cool but what I'm saying is

he didn't strike me immediately as wow

this dude's fucking hardcore he struck

me as well

this dude's getting really lucky and

that doesn't change until about the

sixth episode there are great moments

that he has where he you know pops off

and shit but in the sixth episode is

when he really shines you get to see

what kind of incredible hunter he is and

that's when it really is at its

strongest the 6th 7th and 8th episode I

think are the best in the entire series

and the first three were also really

strong and I think the last three really

bring it home and do it great justice

and really makes me optimistic about the

future of the show and I really love

just about everything they pulled off

even in the filler the four and five I

like the planets

I liked the new environments that they

were showing us they just weren't

recycling the same Star Wars shit you

see in a thousand times up we're going

to Tatooine this is the birthplace of

Luke and here's where Anakin took a shit

when he was 10 years old in the Phantom

Menace you guys remember that

I like how they kept exploring different

areas and showing you different things

and I like showing the entire Mandalore

culture even though them hiding in the

sewers I thought was kind of

underwhelming they're supposed to be

like this super hidden covert place

you're not even sure if they still exist

and yet you can see Pedro Pascal go into

the sewer by just going down like two

sets of stairs and then he's in there

like super secret hideout in the middle

of the fucking city I feel like someone

could have wandered down there by

accident and discovered all of the

Mandalorians down there so it wasn't

really well hidden but I liked seeing

all of them I liked the main forger she

was really cool and especially at the

end when she has her moment of just

badassery the whole show just does a

great job and it makes you bond with the

characters between the relationship

between baby Yoda and Pedro Pascal's

bounty hunter the Mandalorian it's just

a really well shot well-made narrative

and it's really fun to watch there's a

ton of action there's also a ton of just

pretty powerful moments I'd say it makes

you care about even droids you know

these you know hunks of metal the you

know hype them up is just

evil devoid of emotion but by the end

there's a joy that you start to you know

start to care about and bond with and

you don't want to see leave the party or

do anything you want to see them all

together always which is cute

it's a show like kind of you know like

this thing says it's a little bit about

family a little family forms and it's

it's just really enjoyable which I

didn't expect you know with Star Wars

being is messy of a franchise as it is

you don't really expect too much from it

these days or at least I don't but it's

really been kind of crushing it with

Jedi fallen order and now Mandalorian

makes me optimistic for more Star Wars

shit

the cinematic universe I think is

trashed because the rise of the

Skywalker but fuck that said that for a

different day I didn't waste meter on

that but going forward I like where

they're heading with the Mandalorian and

other extended universe stuff which is

great

plugging the Mandalorian into the moist

meter giving it a fat 80% I think if

they could have had a stronger middle

section without 4 & 5 being is out of

place and jarring ly different in a bad

way it could have been a higher a higher

moist counter a higher wetness but when

you have eight episodes two of them

can't be as bad as the fourth and fifth

one were I'm glad that they at least

brought those characters back in because

they introduced some good characters

which is nice but the episodes

themselves just were not very good but

the show overall I think is absolutely

great and it does live up to the hype

that Twitter it goes crazy for and

that's about it so yeah

Moist Meter | Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker

this episode of moist meter was brought

to you by Ray Khan episode 9 was bad

yeah it's bad

it's really fucking bad this is a super

stinky shitter this is Game of Thrones

season 8 for Star Wars

the only way Star Wars recovers as a

Cinematic Universe is to just give

episode 9 the Dragon Ball GT treatment

just say it's not canon yeah that was

Star Wars GT episode 1 not real I know I

said the last Jedi was my least favorite

in the weakest but at least the last

Jedi had some great moments in it the

kylo Ren and Rey tag team for example

there were some great moments in the

last Jedi and some good scenes and

visuals albeit it was a weak movie

overall this doesn't even have that

there is nothing memorable or great

about this movie at every turn it is

predictable no matter how you look at

this movie it's not even well-made it's

not just a bad Star Wars movie it is a

bad movie objectively it's not well shot

it's not well structured the pacing is

all over the place in the first five

minutes you visit four planets on screen

and you spend 45 seconds to a minute at

each one before it shifts to a different

planet it is all over the place and at

every point in this movie's plot if you

ask yourself how or why an important

moment happens the entire thing falls

apart you have to take so much shit at

face value you're just getting golden

showered by JJ Abrams bad writing it is

not well put together and I don't even

think it all falls on bad writing I

think they wanted to do so many things

but didn't have enough time that they

just cut out the most important moments

of getting to these places so then the

movie ends up just being a whole bunch

of conveniences and just absolute

nonsensical shit that happens and I

think one thing is going to be clear to

everyone who sees this movie Palpatine

was never meant to come back in this new

trilogy that was never the plan at no

point in this movie did it ever get

justified how he's here how he survived

what he's doing it at no point that I

think okay this makes sense this is what

they were building towards cuz it's

clearly not he comes in out of fucking

nowhere it would have made more sense of

his Jar Jar Binks they brought in here

to be

big bad villain this is truly

nonsensical and it's just downright

laughable for them saying that this was

the plan all along it wasn't he actually

comes out of fucking nowhere it would

have been more cinematic if he wrote in

on 15 horses like space fucking horses

and just said yep I'm here to fuck

things up that would have made as much

sense as their explanation here he does

not fit in narrative Lee he comes in for

no reason out of nowhere and you

remember Snoke you know the big bad

villain they set up in episode 7 who was

killed off immediately in episode 8 with

no explanation about who or what he was

he's given a single line in this movie

to explain who and what he was one line

that is about eight or nine words that's

what they gave their initial big bad

villain it's just silly

episodes 1 through 8 become absolutely

useless in this movie they're totally

worthless and this movie completely

nullifies the original trilogy ray is so

incredibly overpowered out of nowhere

she can do anything you ever thought

possible in the Star Wars universe if

you saw anyone in any Star Wars media

use some power Rey has it at her

disposal in this movie for no fucking

reason it just comes out of nowhere she

even has a power that completely ruins

what set up the entire Star Wars

conflict in the fucking first place I'm

not spoiling anything and it's really

hard to talk about this without spoiling

it and Jackson as you know is the

goddamn preeminent prodigy of anything

regarding Star Wars seeing every movie

watched every TV show played every Star

Wars game including the most important

ones the Lego Star Wars ones he knows

his shit and he thinks this is the worst

Star Wars movie yet as well it actually

does completely ruin the original

trilogy I don't want to give away how or

why but there's something raised ray

does that throws the out of whack what

even sets up star wars in the fucking

first place and there's no explanation

for how she's able to do it or where she

got it or how it even it fucking exists

in the universe when it was established

it doesn't and it can't exist

it's fucking silly it's super bad there

is two positives there's only two

complements I think this movie will ever

deserve the music so where's music is

always incredible and this is no

exception the score in this phenomenal

absolutely phenomenal and - god damn it

some of the acting is great Adam driver

is so not so god damn Talent

I really think the acting crushes it I

think the characters do really well with

what they're given and they're given

some straight garbage they're given

something straight out of JJ Abrams

hemorrhoids and I am well aware of jaber

JJ Abrams didn't like fucking sit down

and Solo write this himself it would've

been far worse but it's very bad

material they're given to work with and

I think they do a great job with it I

really do those are the only two

compliments I can give it there's no

memorable scenes there's no good scenes

there's no great visuals either it's

very generic sci fi shots that every

single planet every single starship the

space battles underwhelming the

lightsaber battles kind of fucking blow

which is rare because I think the

lightsaber battles have been a highlight

in the new trilogy it's just there's not

a lot to like here at all and everything

comes at random that's the biggest

problem

things are just coming out of nowhere at

random characters showing up saying

things doing things that them finding

things it's as if there's always like a

puppet master in the back when the

characters get lost just whispering to

him hey go here and do this and then

they do it just they get it out of

nowhere they get these there's a not

spoiling anything again but towards the

end of the movie the plans are going

awry and things get changed up but

luckily the good guys are able to see

through that plan because one of the

good guys says wait a minute I have a

feeling and that feeling turns out to be

incredibly accurate and saves the day

based off of nothing I don't know why

the character got the feeling that's not

even like it was a force sensitive

character who's getting like a fucking

forced tingle in his penis does the

character says I got a feeling they go

with it and it works it's it's silly

it's bad it's it's very juvenile writing

here it's it doesn't it doesn't make

sense it doesn't make any sense at all

there's so little to like about this

movie there really is no matter how much

you love the characters and I love the

Star Wars characters the new the new

characters not so much but that's not

really their fault I think the actors

and actresses are talented they just

haven't been well written they haven't

been well developed but I do like kylo

Ren in this movie he's not horrible I

mean at least he's okay he's kind of

still true to the character they've

established which is good the rest

though this is not there's not much to

like the characters aren't given enough

to do meaningfully or in a way that

makes sense like with respect to

intelligence

it's it's I can't spoil anything but

fuck it's bad it's just not a good movie

now one thing I do appreciate and I

don't think it's done overly well but

the fanservice there's a lot of nods to

previous Star Wars movies before they

totally shit on them by overriding what

really sets them in motion there's good

nods to some some old Star Wars

properties some characters have

emotional moments that aren't executed

beautifully but it's enough to get a

response out of people that have grown

up with some of these characters and I'd

like to see where they're ending up in

their role in the movie and the

conclusion so I do think there are good

moments where there is some cuteness

between characters that some of us have

known for decades and I think that is

that's nice if nothing else and I really

can't stress enough how great John

Williams is with this music and this

that is honestly just probably the best

part of the movies the goddamn music

which is sad considering this is

supposed to be the conclusion to a story

so many fucking years in the making it's

just not a good movie though

plugging this into the moist meter rise

of the skywalker is getting a 40% it's a

shame it's a real shame in their

conclusion they outright nullified half

of what made Star Wars story happen in

the fucking first place it is it's

unbelievable to me and they do it so

carelessly that they do it so like they

don't give a fuck as if it's like a big

old you know JJ Abrams just bending over

to show fans his asshole

he just slides it in and they'd I guess

he doesn't realize it doesn't care how

important that detail was it's very big

what he's thrown in here and the

consequences of its existence thrown out

of whack all of Star Wars and I think

that's probably its biggest sin aside

from just being a bad movie that has at

least 20 different planets across its

entire two-and-a-half hour runtime and

you're constantly trying to remember why

they were there in the first place oh

they're going there for that but that

didn't work but then they found out

about this so they're going there for

this wait but wait no no they just they

just learned from some dude in the

background shouting that they need to go

here so they're gonna oh that's why

they're going there right because that

dude was shouting it's a mess it's an

absolute convoluted mess of a plot that

just doesn't work there's nothing

cohesive about it it is truly a shame

and I think it's going to be a letdown

to the

majority of people that see this movie

even if you loved episode eight which

was super divisive you're not gonna like

this one I don't think I just don't see

what there is to really like about it

it's also extremely predictable in

exactly how it's going to end once it

gets to that point you see what's

happening and it's just not good that's

about it so yeah yeah the new Star Wars

may have been overwhelmingly

disappointing but you know it's not

disappointing fucking raike on baby I've

talked about these bad boys multiple

times but I can't stress enough just how

much I do enjoy them not only are they

comfortable it feels like a nice sweet

hug from your grandmother in your ear

but they have revolutionized my gym

experience because I used to use wired

headphones at the gym which always got

in the way of sets and we're just

genuinely a nuisance I'd constantly

ripped them out by accident putting

weights down and it was just terrible

but with Ray Con I don't have that

problem the audio quality is pristine

and they're just as good as other

premium audio brands would start at half

the price it is truly a fantastic

product that I can't stress enough how

much I enjoy so yeah if you're

Moist Meter | Dr. Stone

this episode of moist Amita was brought

to you by crunchyroll doctor stone I

find to be an incredibly unique anime

and just general show with an idea and

premise I've never seen explored

successfully in any medium

I fucking love doctor stone the show is

about a anomaly that occurs in the

modern age that petrifies all of

humanity turning them to stone for

thousands of years three thousand seven

hundred years after three thousand seven

hundred years the protagonist named

Cinque who wakes up and Cinco is like

Google waking up he has the accumulation

of two million years worth of humanities

knowledge at his disposal he's the

preeminent prodigy of science he knows

everything there is to know about

building shit and making shit and what

he wants to do is bring humanity back

and back into the modern age starting

from literally nothing bare-ass naked

full asshole out wants to bring humanity

from that point all the way to the point

where we've got television porn all of

that again it is an incredible show it's

like watching primitive technology but

across an entire show in the beginning

he makes clothes out of leaves he uses

hammers and chisels made out of stones

where he's banging stones against other

stones he's using some of the same tools

you see primitive technology using waste

you know whirling fucking twigs into the

strings that he needs it's really

impressive and all of what they show is

accurate in terms of the science and the

tools that they use and how they get to

those point the chemicals the reactions

all of it is accurate I knew some of it

I didn't know most of it and I

fact-checked that shit I fact-checked

that bitch constantly just to see if I

could point a finger and say nope you're

wrong you lied to me this is wrong and

at no point did I ever come across that

case all of the science they show here

and everything they make they tell you

how they do it and it is all exactly how

it is done which I find to be impressive

when I first went into this show and

knowing the premise I thought I was

gonna be making a whole bunch of leaps

and shit using magic you know out of

nowhere one episode sink who's got his

cock and balls out because he's butt-ass

naked after being unpatriotic stepa

sewed he's got fucking Home Depot tools

at his disposal and he's using a power

drill

set up the first RGB gaming keyboard I

didn't know it'd be step by step from

ground zero making the tools and then

making this shit with the tools and

building upon that foundation and every

step of the way it was fascinating it

was genuinely educational in a very fun

way and as the show progresses there's

more and more characters that get

introduced and obviously none of them

are up the sink whose level of

understanding science some of them don't

even believe science is a real thing

because they're in this primitive world

where there is no science there is no

technology and sink who's the only one

that can bring it back so he's

constantly explaining how things work to

the characters in the show which in turn

explains it to the viewer which is

really fucking cool teaching you how to

make goddamn fucking I don't spoil

anything but making some really

impressive shit teaching you how

electricity and shit works like it's

really crazy and over the course of the

24 episodes in the season he goes from

nothing to having some pretty impressive

stuff at his disposal and it doesn't

feel at any step that it was a huge jump

where all of a sudden he has nothing and

now he has you know as telescopes and

space shuttles they have everything in

between that builds up to that point

showing you every step in teaching you

every step how they got there which I

find great it's never slow it never

drags there's constant inventions

constant shit going on

I think the villain is also really well

realized I think it's a really cool

villain there's really nothing I didn't

enjoy about this show I can see why some

people wouldn't like it and maybe find

it boring because it really is a show

that is mainly about building characters

and building shit inventing things and

some people may not care about that it's

not like other animes in its category

where you've got constant sword battles

you got ass cheeks going against

assholes in these constant fights and

there's a lot of action that isn't here

in dr. stone there is action and there

is scenes of fighting but it's very

scarce it is mainly about these

characters interacting with science

discovering things and building things

all of which I think worked really well

in the context of the show and make it

really thrilling and fun and at times

just downright gorgeous if I had to

nitpick one complaint though I felt

towards the end of the season things got

a little bit too fast-paced if that

makes any sense what I mean by that is

they'd spend five episodes collecting

one mineral or one

chemical what they need for an invention

but then towards the end of the season

if they needed to invent something they

didn't have it it only took them an hour

or one scene to get it immediately and

bring it back and then they made the

invention whereas that same task took

them five episodes previously so it just

feels like at some point they just

disregarded a lot of the the grunt work

that they were showing and a lot of the

explanation that they were giving kind

of like what Game of Thrones did with

travel where it took an entire fucking

season for an army to march and then in

season seven or eight they could get

there and literally two scenes and I get

why they kind of gloss over those those

scenes have been gathering what they

need and explaining exactly how

everything works they focus more their

explanations on the things that are

extremely important in the show and

towards the end they just kind of gloss

over a lot of the stuff and I don't mind

it that much because it would be kind of

boring just to watch them go do more

gathering that you've already seen and

then another explanation for something

that you probably didn't really need to

know because it's not gonna be the most

important component in the show or

anything so I get glossing over it for

time it's not that big of a deal but it

is something that does break the show's

establish the rules of it's a lot of

work to get these things and here's how

it all works at some point you have to

accept it's not a whole lot of work at a

certain point and they don't need to

explain everything and that's fine by me

plugging dr. stone into the moist meter

I'm giving it a nice fat old 90% this is

probably my favorite anime of the year

but I imagine it'll be kind of divisive

for people who either aren't into anime

or only into a certain kind of anime

because it is very different it is an

extremely unique show some of the

characters aren't overly unique in the

genre but overall the show itself has

its own very niche identity and I think

it's great I really really enjoyed it

from start to finish and I can't

recommend the show enough really fucking

good stuff

now during streams when anime gets

brought up as a conversational topic

they always ask me where I watch it

where I watch my anime I've always

watched anime on crunchyroll I find

crunchyroll just to have the best

catalog of anime pretty much anything

that comes out is going to be on

crunchyroll and almost immediately as

well doctor stone fire force Demon

Slayer all of it just right there I

don't have to search the web endlessly

waiting to try and find something that

works

crunchyroll not only works but its

catalog is just so massive you can

pretty much find any anime you've either

moderately interested in watching

there's also a crunchyroll premium that

lets you watch all anime totally ad free

and let's be honest no one wants to sit

through an ad when they're watching a

show also with premium you never have to

worry about the quality being anything

less than superb top the line study the

art glorious 1080p chakra vibrating

levels of quality also with crunchyroll

premium you get the anime an hour after

it airs in Japan so it's quick and the

subtitles are professionally done

Moist Meter | Frozen 2

this episode was brought to you by rake

on frozen whether or not you've seen it

you've definitely fuckin heard it I

promise you that let it go a song that

was everywhere that song was more

popular than in America than the fucking

Pledge of Allegiance more well-known

than the Bible

let it go was a fucking phenomenon and

I'm happy to say in frozen - there's

nothing that's going to reach that level

so you won't be absolutely ass blasted

by the same song ad nauseam and

everything ever that's not to say frozen

see doesn't doesn't have good songs but

it doesn't have nearly as good a song as

the first frozen the only - like actual

shine through songs and frozen to our

show yourself and into the unknown

other than that oh they're very

forgettable musical numbers overall the

movies not bad by no means could you

ever say frozen - is a bad movie it

doesn't come close to the first movie

which I had only just seen recently for

the first time and it was a good movie

but frozen - doesn't even really come

close to that this does feel like more

of a cash grab than an actual project of

passion with something to tell you and

something to teach you it's a cute movie

this story is a real grasping at straws

it's about Elsa's power and its origin

it's a movie that doesn't even have an

antagonist that doesn't have a villain

without spoiling anything characters get

separated characters end up in a very

bad situation a real fucking bad pickle

and it seems like it's going to be a

really important moment where a lot of

bad things are gonna happen as a result

and there's this big obstacle they have

to overcome that's gonna have a lot of

consequences and for about five minutes

of the movie that's the case until it is

all peacefully resolved almost

immediately after coming onto the screen

it's really underwhelming because what's

supposed to be and what seems to be a

moment that's going to have a lot of

buildup until it's solved is solved

almost fucking instantly it's just it's

a very low stakes kind of movie which

isn't necessarily bad in and of itself

but when the movie is talking about how

high the stakes are you know the

elements

are at odds and fighting with them when

you see the elements they're just kind

of minor inconveniences and it's just

underwhelming for lack of a better term

especially when you have the scope of

Elsa's powers and the extent of what she

gets to use it for is just walking

across water it's a far cry from what

you saw in the first movie and there's

some decisions mainly towards the end of

this movie then I just can't believe

made it to the final cut this movie

feels like it's missing 40 some minutes

of actual content without spoiling

anything to tell you what I mean there

is a scene where characters are

separated characters make choices that

should have massive consequences and for

all of five minutes they do before it's

just resolved peacefully and nothing has

really changed as a result of making

these incredibly impulsive and without

thinking type decisions that should have

had dire consequences but didn't because

they didn't feel like making more of the

movie and I think that's kind of what

this movie is about they wanted to make

a movie that is passable for frozen but

not great and that's what it comes

across as of course the animation is

beautiful breathtaking at moments

there's beautiful scenes especially

during the show yourself musical number

all the things they show you look great

sound great

of course you're getting that with

Disney animation

you already knew that was coming but

what it's missing is a soul and to a kid

that's not going to matter I get that

this movie is 100% geared towards

children if you're an adult fan of

frozen you're probably not gonna find a

whole lot to like about this movie in

comparison to the first you'll probably

end up a little disappointed unless

you're really just a huge fan of the

music and don't really care about much

else except the visuals cuz the visuals

are even better in this movie than the

first one for sure but you know if

you're going there expecting something

like frozen one had you're not going to

find it they just came up with something

that is good enough not really anything

great which is kind of a shame but to be

expected

you know hater hate them or love them

Olaf's in the movie Kristoff has been

reduced to just kind of being like a

comedic relief presence occasional

he doesn't really do anything at all

he's just kind of there then he has like

I bet if you put the script that if you

like printed out the script he'd find

maybe fifteen lines from kristov across

the entire movie it's he's not really a

huge player in this one at all

but that doesn't really matter that much

either because again the focal point is

on the relationship between Elsa and

Anna and their little personal adventure

into Elsa's origins but anyway I'm

plugging us in the moist meter frozen

twos it's a 70% it is a good movie but

it really is just a soulless one it's I

don't have a massive problem with it

because again to a kid that's not going

to matter and I myself was not the

hugest fan of frozen when I saw it

recently I get for its time it was

probably lightning in a bottle some shit

like no one expected to be as good as it

was but for me going into seeing it so

many years later I found it to just be

ordinary decent good not incredible or

great and this movie isn't even up to

that level in my opinion not a bad movie

though a couple weeks ago I first

mentioned how I upgraded to Ray Conover

the wired earphones for when I go to the

gym and while my physique may not

indicate that I'm some type of meaty

monster muscle man I do go to the gym

about five times a week so these fucking

ray cons are getting worked out as well

and I was just very concerned over my

own personal safety with the wire to

your phones cuz these wires are exposed

like a motherfucker and I don't want to

get electrocuted at the gym during a rep

also they were just really inconvenient

doing a rep and sometimes catching the

wire and ripping that shit out of my ear

overall just significantly better than

the wired earphones that I'm used to

they're much more comfortable they sound

better they sound just as good as the

other premium audio brands ray cons also

less expensive than the other premium

audio brands so click the link in the

description below and you can find a

great deal on ray Khan they have their

Black Friday deals coming up and I

highly recommend them so click the link

Police Challenged Me To Complete Their Training Academy

when you look at me what do you see just

a man or perhaps you see a man that

could potentially be extremely efficient

at laying the long dick of justice down

the next John McClane perhaps John

McClane is Bruce Willis's character in

the Die Hard series I don't know why I

felt the need to explain that but I feel

like if you're not talking and memes on

the Internet half the people just don't

even understand what the fuck you're

saying anyway that's it's die hard is

what that reference was what I'm trying

to say is at the streams I do it

twitch.tv slash moist critical we watch

a lot of live PD make a lot of jokes

about live PD I talk a lot of shit about

some of the officers and some of the

shit on live PD and now I have been

formally challenged by my local police

department to come do some of their

police training and do I look like the

kind of man that's gonna back down from

a fucking challenge like that god no

so what do we do now we get out

oh excuse the shit out of me

you let me down officer okay hard you

hard jump for a second yeah I was calm

the whole time yeah as you can see my

reflexes and reaction time would make

even Google's quantum computer jealous

and envious now to give this some

context this exercise was the simulated

traffic stop and then not knowing what's

going to happen My partner is my good

friend Andrew or huggbees on YouTube and

he's gonna have a video on this if you

want to see it from his perspective as a

six foot four giant monster man and

obviously what happened is the two

officers playing the criminals got out

and went full nuts to butts action mode

with their shotguns and just fucking

blasted at us now luckily my instincts

kicked in and I went full fuckin Jason

Bourne mode on him I ran behind the

police car knowing that was the optimal

position for cover and Andrew knew the

optimal position for cover was behind me

as you can see here in this picture he's

just sniffing my fucking asshole and

hoping I absorb all the bullets until

they run out we weren't firing blanks

they just intentionally missed us so

likely I would have just been a pile of

fucking meat on the ground if those were

live rounds I would have looked like a

Gears of War Chainsaw death but they

decided not to shoot us I wasn't so

merciful what we had were tracer rounds

or marker rounds I don't remember but

it's like a modified plastic bullet

where the tip has paint on it it's a

plastic tip instead of a metal one so

you're not just a fucking executing

people during training and I returned

fire and all of my shots were right on

target

I'm like a fucking prodigy oh we got

shot well rinsed out there and then if

you can see the sleeve Wow nice now were

you aiming away from us

Oh how did you get him to not to flex

too hard on all you pussies out there

but the guns only had four tracer rounds

in him and all four of my shots hit two

on each if you were scoring that as a

professional judge if that was a

competition for example I'd be a perfect

score no doubt about it

it's also important to note that I've

been shooting a long time it's not my

first rodeo behind a handgun and that

didn't have nearly as much kick back as

a normal gun so the odds were in my

favor that I was going to be a deadly

shot out here but regardless we would

have died 15 seconds before I fired a

single bullet because of the rapid

amount of shotgun shells they were able

to unload in my panic

Oh

I thought it came from over here

actually

it sounded like it came from over here

all right

the officers perspective what what

happened is you were walking two gunshot

sounds I think you reacted to the echo

off the building yeah so I could I

couldn't get a visual on where the shots

were coming from okay suspects ran away

I noticed that you drew my weapon tried

to hit him and checked on the deceased

okay so here's the important question

what's he a suspect

a victim or a witness at that point it

wouldn't matter I was just executing I

have a great shot good shot yes yeah

once again absolutely perfect shots I

could shoot the pubic hair off a

bumblebee from over a hundred yards away

needless to say though perhaps the

decision-making could be called into

question and my reaction time in fact I

looked everywhere but where the shots

actually came from and then by the time

I registered it I just saw a man running

and at that point is like a fucking dog

chasing a car I was just I was just

coming after it so I I put him down but

man did I put him down in style all four

of those shots hit right up on his upper

back like right around his neck I

fucking severed his spine with that shit

I was like a razor blade a saw of

bullets but everything else I did there

blue ass and was not textbook or

protocol I imagine I guess one thing

that this didn't teach me that I didn't

think about is when a cop pulls over a

car it is pulling over a totally fucking

random car if I did that shit I'd

probably be terrified out of my goddamn

mind I can't even go up to a cashier and

pay for stuff without thinking they're

gonna try something fishy on me so I

guess that's amplified by a hundred when

you just pull over a car on the street

but that being said while I may not be

the best traffic officer my god could I

be the best traffic assassin like you

know let's say a cop didn't pull over a

car and he's taken three hostages

he's got three children stacked on top

of each other that he's using as a meat

shield there's only a small opening

underneath the armpit of one of the kids

on top I can probably squeeze a shot

through there and get him right between

the eyes my marksmanship here my sharp

shooting was remarkable

nothing else looking towards that

[Applause]

oh it's daddy yeah that's intense which

gardens look like shit the GoPro on

though where the GoPro yeah

I'm pretty convinced that the officers

here did a little scouting report on me

beforehand did their homework and learn

that I am very prone to motion sickness

I don't know how many of you knew that

about me but I get motion sick very

easily and one of the courses they did

put us through here was their escape and

pursuit tactics behind the wheel of a

vehicle that's often a point of jokes

during live PD because some of this shit

just looks super lame like a child

playing with Hot Wheels badly but after

being in there I'm still gonna make

jokes about the pursuits on life PD

occasionally but man after being in

there I realized I would not be able to

survive that I would be puking so

goddamn hard the criminals would win if

they just made me do a simple donut or

like a four point turn quickly because

my god I was miserable after this little

set of stunts driving fast and furious

shit I was just miserable for the time

was at the police academy I was sick for

the rest of the day that 12 hours after

this I was just miserably ill it fucked

my stomach up I felt like a bundle of

assholes who I rode you gotta take into

consideration the slippery daytime and

nightime your make sure you get him

barfing out the window hopefully it

won't come to that turn this camera

I'm like we're gonna pretty close we

haven't even started

we're going we may have won but I feel

like I've lost oh by the time this

high-speed pursuit component rolled

around I was already damn near delirious

from all the motion sickness so when he

handed me the radio I thought it was for

like the loudspeaker on the police car

where I was you know talking to the

criminals pull over and shit turns out

it was only going to the other police

car in front of us so I was just telling

the other officer my ailments and

begging him to slow down and shit I

thought I was intimidating the criminals

but in fact I was just communicating

with the other vehicle again I would not

I would not fare well in a police chase

at all is what I learned from that

experience there

you watch so much like PD oh yeah I know

all the rules of engagement the Miranda

rights he's gonna apply to be a police

officer by the time I'm done the male is

arguing with the mall employee becomes

aggravated when he sees you so you'll

see it starting to count down to one

excuse me excuse me sir what seems to be

the problem here okay don't ignore me

sir

you're really tempting my patience here

sir

what is this argument over sir yeah come

step over here let's talk about those

prices maybe we're on the same team

Jesus didn't drop it what kind of maniac

brings a hammer to a mall it's right on

the money

I was leading my shot and Casey Jones

that was lightning fast this was the

last exercise you got to take part and

it was their virtual simulator which is

just the hundreds and hundreds of

different scenarios with branching paths

like a fucking telltale game mix with

time crisis because your tasers your

handguns your pepper sprays they all

have little lasers in them so you can

see where you hit or if your days are

even hit and shit like that it was

really interesting and really cool and

it all depends on what you say in how

you handle the situation where it

branches off to obviously I chose the

the bad ending on this one with him

bringing out the hammer like a fucking

WWE finisher so I didn't handle it that

well but in my defense he was ignoring

me but I also see why would cuz I'm

five foot six so I guess I wasn't that

intimidating to him but anyway I was

expecting to go in there and like

diffuse live bombs and shit but just due

to time and when we went we didn't get

to take part in all the extreme stuff in

either way though it was a lot of fun

and I'm glad that they had us out there

to do that I'd say overall I passed the

course challenges maybe it may be kind

of if you just disregard anything

involving the police vehicles I think I

did pretty well everywhere else but the

second you put me behind one of those

fucking spinning cars doing your stunts

and shit I'm fucked but I'm gonna say I

passed that's it so yeah

Moist Meter | Pokemon Sword and Shield

initiating moisture the reception of

Pokemon Sauron Sheol from professional

game journalists has completely

convinced me that that shit has to be

paid for I'm on some Illuminati shit

here now because there is no way that

this game deserves perfect scores and

high 90s across the board most gamers

get upset about Call of Duty getting

high scores despite being pretty much

carbon copies year after year but I

don't know why they're not more upset

about Pokemon this is genuinely the same

fucking game that Game Freak has been

printing for the last couple decades but

in sword and shields case there's even

less content than you're used to and

it's even lazier Game Freak has set a

new low for laziness half the time the

fucking audio in the game doesn't even

work and when it does it sounds like

it's muffled underwater through 15

different farts and a walkie talkie I

don't know what the fuck has gone wrong

with the sound when you beat the game

the final cutscene has a mouse cursor in

it it just feels outright lazy and they

cut the majority of the fucking Pokemon

roster that Pokemon fans are used to

seeing in the games to make it smaller

and more streamlined cut out a lot of

the other mechanics as well admittedly

there are some decent quality of life

changes they've made that I really did

appreciate but overall there's so much

less content for an even higher price I

just don't understand how anyone can

view that and be like wow that's a

hundred percent right there they'd

fucking kill that Game Freak standing

ovations maybe a Game Freak deserves a

little sympathy perhaps they're just

fucking trapped in a basement for most

of their life and then when Nintendo

needs them to dance like some type of

twisted puppeteer that let them out of

the basement

but Game Freak has been in there for

decades so all they know is the same

goddamn gameplay loop from decades ago

so that's all they can really produce

and it still worked for them I don't

really know the situation but I can't

imagine why they're so content with

pumping out the same exact game every

time but this one somehow they decided

to just give you an even bigger fuck you

by making it so much more laughably easy

it's a Pokemon game it's made for all

ages but mainly kids can get in there

and do well in the game I get that but

this game never ever lets go of your

hand it's the most over aggressive

parent grabbing you by both hands and

it's like you're fucking both arms are

broken so they're jerking you off to

because at nope

in this game do they ever give you the

freedom to do what you want without some

type of tutorial some type of blatant

guidance and making you play the game it

wants you to play it the way it wants

you to play it and the characters are

absolute fucking dogshit your rival hop

is just terrible at no point is it ever

a challenge to beat hop or fight hop

it's always such a chore you start

feeling bad for the goddamn kid halfway

through the game because you know you're

just gonna steamroll him and he only has

depression issues at one point in the

game and then he challenges you and you

just go cock slap them again with your

Pokemon roster because all this guy

catches his fucking sheep it's it's a

waste and he's constantly challenging

you to rival battles and then your big

bad gang I guess your team rocket

equivalent but not exactly Team Rocket

equivalent but the big bad gang they're

gonna keep going into team yell is this

absolutely awful as well it's a group of

adults that are rabid fans of a child

this is a fucking group of pedophiles

that constantly stalk and follow around

this child pokemon trainer who they

adore and they fight on her honor

they're like fucking twitch chat virgins

defending their favorite streamer from

criticism but in this game you

constantly have to engage with them

directly you can't just ignore them you

have to keep having these meaningless

tedious battles with them at every step

and speaking of tedious at every gym

battle they have these dumb fucking gym

mission minigames that do nothing but

Pat out a little bit of time in the gym

it's so frustrating it's so silly but

let's get to some things I like because

there are things I like obviously the

gameplay being exactly the same it's

still Pokemon gameplay so the gameplay

loop is fine it's still fun it is

admittedly always fun and exciting to

catch new Pokemon find new Pokemon setup

the Pokemon the way you want them to

with their TMS their items their

equipment level them up how you want

speaking of levelling one of the quality

of life changes is XP shares on by

default hate it or love it it's there by

default it's you know it's just Pokemon

gameplay if you like it you'll love it

if you don't like it you won't like it

there's no innovation there the only new

element they've added is raids but raids

barely fucking work if you're playing

online because what they have is called

a stamp system and the stamp system

takes like 10 goddamn minutes to refresh

your stamps even if you do like

disconnect

reconnect to the internet you stamps

won't refresh for 10 minutes so by the

time you see a stamp that shit's been

over for 50 minutes by now you're never

gonna get into a raid consistently

unless you're playing with friends it's

both a limitation of the awful Nintendo

online that for some reason they cannot

make better they just have this archaic

system for online gameplay that I can't

fucking stand

it's just laughable it's so primitive it

makes me sick to my stomach and coupled

with the stamp system for finding your

raids and you have a recipe for disaster

and boredom and if you're trying to do

an online battle I hope you're prepared

for a lot of sitting with your fists in

your asshole because the amount of times

that a communication pops up and then

you end up waiting a minute for that to

go through because the Nintendo online

lost you know control Nintendo forgot

what internet was for a moment so you

have to wait there for it to

re-establish the connection it's

frustrating it is absolutely frustrating

anything anything online is just

frustrating and that's entirely because

of Nintendo online I can't even blame

Pokemon sword and shield itself because

Nintendo just doesn't even know what the

fucking internet is it feels like as

Smash Bros was plagued by this same

problem and the stamps just make it even

worse in this game but and uh also the

online makes the wild lag which is

basically your free roam area that shit

lags really hard if you're connected

online you'll get some big framedrops

and a lot of pop in pop out shit just at

every step it feels so messy incomplete

and clunky I have no idea why they put

this on the switch this could easily be

on the DS there's really nothing here

that shows me that it it uses the power

of the switch yes it is a visual

improvement yes some of the animations

do look very good I actually quite like

the look of Dyna maxing and some of the

attacks from Dyna maxing I think they

look very nice on the switch although

the Dynomax animation taking 20 seconds

every time is a bit frustrating but yes

at times it does look very nice but that

isn't that huge of an improvement

visually to justify the extra $20 and

the new Pokemon certainly aren't going

to be enough to persuade you to get the

game there's only a handful of new

Pokemon that I think are really

nice-looking Pokemon very well designed

and they look pretty fucking cool

there's definitely some of those in here

but then there's also the majority of

the roster that looks like absolute shit

that it seems like no effort went into

it that they were just sitting around

the office and pointing at things saying

that'll be a Pokemon that'll be a

Pokemon is that it oh my is that a

fucking rock outside that's gonna be a

Pokemon there's a there's a rock pokémon

in this game that is actually just a

stack of rocks to look like Stonehenge

even more insulting there's a Pokemon in

this game that is just a teacup it's

fucking stupid the new Pokemon on the

most part aren't very good they're not

justifying getting rid of their whole

roster to put an emphasis on this group

of lame fucking characters these rejects

but there are some good ones in there I

will definitely say I liked some of them

but overall I just don't see under any

circumstance this game getting glowing

reviews now it's perfectly fine to like

this game and I totally understand why

you would I still fucking love the

gameplay but I can recognize some

objective flaws in the game and also in

my personal opinion if you're going to

make a new entry into a franchise there

needs to be a justification for this new

entry making a carbon copy of the same

fucking game I don't think is something

that should be praised or even really

accepted to me that's just a greedy move

slapping a fresh coat of paint on

something without really making a

meaningful change to it and the only

thing this game offers is raids that

only work with friends not online which

is supposed to be the biggest component

of that but obviously if you have

friends the raids work and those work

out nicely with your friends but when

you're going from a handheld like a DS

to a console like the switch there's a

certain expectation that needs to be met

is the first Pokemon game that we've

ever gotten on a console so the

expectation would be something exciting

something different something that uses

the power of the switch to put a fresh

take on the established formula and the

established franchise but you don't get

that what you get is the exact same game

that you're used to getting but a little

more simplified and with less in it

that's not a subjective statement you

are getting the same product but you're

getting less of it for a higher price

and that's not a flaw I think should be

overlooked you can still love the game

despite that and I totally understand

the people that do but that is still an

objective flaw of this game you are

getting what you've always got

but less of it and then some of its

components genuinely just don't even

fucking work popping this bad boy into

the moist meter I'm giving it an even

50% and the only reason it's out of 50%

which I consider an average game is

because the gameplay loop is still very

satisfying but I do think when you're

making a new entry into a franchise you

need to have certain level of

improvements to justify its existence

otherwise why not just make it a DLC or

change certain things about the arty

existing game so you need to be able to

look at the previous entry and the new

one and compare that you saying huh what

did the new one do differently that the

last one didn't I loved the gameplay in

the previous one and I still liked it in

this one but is there anything different

about it and if there's nothing

different well why did you make it in

the first place it's the same problem

Call of Duty had the community used to

be outraged when Call of Duty year after

you would get very high scores with very

minimal improvements or differences

between them

Pokemon's the same case there really

needs to be at least some level of

trying to make things different between

entries and their solution for this one

was to take shit away that was their

spin on the gameplay to make it more

simplified that's not exactly the most

fun fucking way of doing things hey

here's the gameplay you know and love

let's just give you less of it that's

not exactly the way to go about it in my

opinion but it is still fun at its core

and yeah that's about it so yeah

Moist Meter | Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order

this episode was brought to you by keeps

going somewhere

I recognize that stuns perhaps you've

had some training after all

who's your master Padawan Star Wars Jedi

fallen order is a lot better than I

expected it to be I'm happy to say I was

a lot of fucking fun from start to

finish now it's important we address the

elephant in the room before talking

about the game itself it's made by

Respawn Entertainment who has a great

track record of great games like

titanfall titanfall - apex but it is

published by EA who's the devil it's

like Voldemort you can't say the name

out loud to all the hardcore gamers you

avoid EA games like showers at least

that's what you say on reddit II still

buy all their games and shit EA yeah

they published it but there's no

microtransactions like you're used to

from that shit company so I'm happy to

say that it is a game that is very truly

meant to be a game for both Star Wars

fans and just fans of action games in

general I want to start with the best

part about this game which is the combat

the gameplay in this game never gets

stale throughout its entire 15 hour

journey and keep in mind that's without

me exploring every nook and cranny on

every planet and getting a hundred

percent so there's a lot of content

there and there's a lot of lore in the

game scattered throughout the world so

there's a lot to really pick up on if

you're a fan of the lore of Star Wars

and all of it is canon according to the

master mind Disney so that's great for

Star Wars fans but I really think the

biggest shining factor of this game is

its combat the gameplay is just always

fun and rewarding its most closely

resembling anything from the souls

franchise more specifically taquito

which is an absolutely great game that I

love now obviously the first thing that

people are gonna ask is it really hard

like the souls series and I played the

whole thing through on Grand Master

difficulty which is the hardest one i

streamed at all at twitch.tv slash moist

critical and I can confidently say there

are definitely times in this game where

it's extremely hard and I definitely got

hung up on certain mobs and encounters

in particular one mini boss called like

the rabid ask beater or something I

don't quite remember it took me like 20

minutes to beat him and the final boss

was slapping my asphalt inside and out

for like 30 minutes so it definitely is

hard at certain points but overall the

game itself is much easier than

something in the souls franchise not

that that's a complaint for me at all I

don't think the game needs to be

cutthroat and putting the fear of God

and you to be fun I just know it's a

natural question when you compare

something to the souls series now I

think the reason

it's easier than most games and that

franchise is the amount of tools you

have at your disposal you get so many

really fun and interesting force powers

that you can constantly use in a fight

to turn the tide in your favor if your

tactical enough if you have a galaxy

brain and you're getting attacked by

five stormtroopers and a goat on zepho

maybe you lead them to the edge of a

cliff and you jump over them do a giant

force slow on the entire mob and then

force push them all off the cliff wiping

the board instantly there's a lot of

really cool powers that you can use in

these fights that make it a lot of fun

but the one-on-one fights are just as

fun if not more fun because the parrying

mechanic I think works really well it's

very flashy and there's some decent

combos that you can use but it's not a

very combo heavy game it's more so on

timing and rhythm just like saakitto was

I really enjoyed the combat start to

finish

there's more than one lightsaber style

there is double-sided lightsaber of

course which is iconic and I just think

there's so much to play with in a lot to

enjoy when it comes to actually fighting

enemies and there is a lot of enemies to

fight there's a lot of fucking hardcore

action and outside of the action I think

the puzzles are pretty well made some of

the puzzles definitely had me looking

pretty goddamn dumb on stream but I

think that's what makes them fun is when

they're challenging for you and you have

to really think hard to figure out how

to get to the secret or find a

collectible or get an upgrade or just

progress in the game there's a lot of

puzzles and there's a lot of ways of

approaching them and I think that's very

nice and I also just like the map design

in general everything connects in a you

know pretty intuitive way so you're

never overly lost and there's a good map

system that you can always access and

just figure your way around it's just

overall the gameplay everything that

Department is super enjoyable not only

the combat just everything surrounding

it the only thing I will nitpick on a

bit is there are many bosses that defend

upgrades occasionally and they're just

re skins of enemies you've already

fought they're not very inspired many

bosses sometimes they're challenging yes

but they are in general just a reskin of

what you've already fought that's a

little disappointing that they didn't

put much work into that but it's not

that big of a deal

enemy variety is pretty decent across

the board most of the shit you'll be

fighting is animals slug goats darth and

goats big toads but outside of that

there's also the storm through

purrs birds troopers it's a lot of stuff

to fight and it's nice I really enjoyed

everything in that department soundtrack

as well as something that stood out to

me I think Star Wars has always had a

really strong soundtrack

although the movies in my opinion are

not all that great the soundtrack always

is the soundtrack always fucking slaps

and that's no different in this game and

the characters in this game I think are

all so well written well acted although

they look very goofy at times because

the animations betray the characters I

think that's something that they didn't

put a lot of work into is making the

animations fluid the game often feels a

bit clunky when you're moving around the

world platforming sometimes ends up a

disaster because you'll face through

something or clip through something you

won't grab something when you should

you'll wall run but you'll end up wall

running right to your own fucking death

and plummeting straight to hell just for

no reason other than just the game not

working entirely as it should and the

same goes for the camera as well often

if you'll engage in a close corridors

combat section sometimes your camera

will get locked outside of the map and

you can't really change it and then

you'll just get brutalized in the locker

room by the stormtroopers and you'll

have to restart because you die in two

or three shots on Grand Master so

sometimes that clunkiness gets

frustrating and it's definitely there

and you can really see it in certain

animations especially the run cycle the

run cycle is downright goofy if you're

sprinting I'd recommend just not even

sprinting so you don't break immersion

because no-one Sprint's the way this guy

does looks like he's just carrying a fat

load of shit in his pants and trying not

to let it spill down his legs but I mean

really overall the game is just a joy to

play and it comes with a really good

story that I think is very engaging and

it's well told albeit goofy at times and

I think their attempts at humor in the

story don't land at all they're really

just half-assed and ham-fisted attempts

to throw in like simple one-liners

towards the end of the game or in the

middle and it just doesn't really work

but the story overall is just really

well told and it's super nice to see and

especially since this takes place in

between the third and fourth movie it's

really good to explore that area cuz I

find that to be a really fascinating

time period for these this franchise to

explore seeing the clone troopers turn

spoiler alert I guess it's just a really

fun set of set pieces that this game

brings and there's a lot of cinematic

elements that I think work really well

sometimes when they throw in a QTE a

QuickTime event at the

it's a little goofy it should've just

been a cutscene but I just really

enjoyed the game plugging this into the

moist meter I'm giving Star Wars Jedi

fallen order of fat 85% it's a game I'd

recommend to anyone who really likes an

action game or if you're a fan of Soul

series combat or sekito combat there's a

lot in this game that it has to offer

you don't have to be a Star Wars fan to

enjoy it and you don't have to be

embarrassed by it either at first I

thought this was gonna be a game for

only like the hardcore Star Wars fans

you know the guys that finger gun into

their mirror pretending to be Han Solo

or putting their action figures before

they go to bed but it's not it's a game

that I think anyone can really enjoy I

know I certainly did did you know the

real reason Anakin turn to the dark side

of the force was because he had spooky

visions of halos this is a vision many

men suffer from though since two out of

three men will suffer from hair loss by

the age of 35 instead of cutting down

younglings though you have a better

choice introducing keeps keeps offers

you proven treatments that help cut down

on hair loss meaning you can keep your

locks for longer with keeps you can

visit a certified doctor online and get

the medication shipped directly and

discreetly to your door the fact is that

prevention is key if you want to keep

your hair so if you notice any thinning

at all hop on capes as soon as possible

as it has up to a 90% chance of stopping

and reducing further hair loss starting

at just $10 a month you can get 50% off

your first order by visiting keeps calm

Moist Meter | Death Stranding

initiating moisture I finally fucking

finished death stranding and now I'm

left confused and yet enlightened I feel

as though Kojima's brilliance has

allowed me to achieve nirvana I feel

like I now have a higher appreciation

for the finer things in art I feel as if

my farts smell better to my nostrils now

because this game transcends anything

you could possibly envision for a video

game this was one of the most tedious

chores I've ever taken on in all 25

years of my time as an elite top-tier

gamer let me get the best things out of

the way the story the setting the

aesthetic the writing though everything

that's not gameplay is good I'll expand

on that in a minute but let me just vent

about the gameplay credit to just roll

that I need to tell you how fucking

awful this gameplay is now I already

know saying that has triggered a fucking

Winter Soldier response and some

commenters that have their pinky out and

finger on the trigger ready for a reddit

comment because I didn't appreciate the

high-quality art it just my American

brain couldn't comprehend things that

weren't bang bang shooty shooty as

kojima says let me justify this position

no matter how you spin this game play it

is boring at no point can this gameplay

even be misconstrued as fun

it becomes tolerable at a certain point

but at its core the gameplay is deliver

packages from point A to point B and

it's typically the slowest and longest

journey possible I had deliveries that

extended 4,100 kilometers and I had to

approach some of that shit on foot due

to batteries running out lack of

generators or just the mountain being

too high and not having enough supplies

for it because you couldn't prepare for

a fucking journey that long you have to

take breaks break it up it's boring

it becomes tolerable with the shared

universe where you can use other players

bridges and roads which help you get

from point A to point B that's fine but

it's never fun it's never enjoyable it's

always just a means to an end to get to

great cutscenes and great writing and

characters never do you revel in the

gameplay and just take time to just

appreciate the walking the being and

Amazon delivery man being a fucking

post-apocalyptic postman with a fetus in

a pickle jar it's never enjoyable it's

so slow it's boring

now I stream this entire game at

twitch.tv slash Moyes critical you can

see that I did everything possible to

make the game more exciting in its

gameplay to make it faster more fun I

spent four fucking hours setting up an

elaborate network of zip lines which is

the fastest form of travel from every

major location in the game or so I

thought from the entire middle of the

game

I spent setting up zip lines to make the

travel between them faster because this

game is all about backtracking and

delivering packages of fucking bricks

from person to person excuse me hologram

to hologram you deliver sperm and eggs

you deliver some trivial shit you

deliver pizza porn magazines yeah

sometimes it's goofy but oftentimes not

often time every time it's never fun the

goofiness is never enough to make the

boring tedium fun it's so insufferably

frustratingly boring and there's so many

anti fun mechanics in this game for no

reason for example the recycling

mechanic could have been totally just

done away with half of the mechanics in

here and features seem so arbitrary and

just there to slap the players face with

Kojima's penis and make it take longer

for no reason it just seems like it's

there to be punishing for the sake of

punishment to give you an example if you

want to build a road it takes a

substantial amount of materials metals

for example in order to get those metals

there you have to individually bring

those briefcases and packages full of

metal to it you can use cars to help but

it's gonna take multiple trips

it is beyond agonizing you feel every

yard traveled with those packages going

to one of the auto pavers for a road and

then you probably don't even use the

road because you progress past it but

then you'll get 20,000 likes from other

players that have used your road and

benefited from your hard work the

fucking sweater your brow the blood

sweat tears and cum you pour it into

getting that road built for them to go

viral on the deaths stranding social

network it's just not fun at any point

it's more fun to spit on your window and

watch it slowly fall to the bottom

there's more fun to be had when you

sneeze into a tissue

there's

our action when you're shaking a protein

shake or mixing something in a blender

not saying this game really needs action

I'm totally fine if there was no action

at all but there is and it's bad by the

way when there is shooting shit it's not

fun

straight out of 2006 mechanics but it

doesn't need action is what I'm saying

but there's more engaging gameplay in a

visual novel than here this gameplay is

just there to punish you in beat tedious

for the sake of tedious and I guess what

everyone defends there is that it's

relaxing or calming or you just don't

get it it fits the world in the tone of

the world who gives a fuck if it fits

the tone of the world if it's not fun

and it's definitely not relaxing because

the vehicle driving mechanics betray you

oftentimes shit has a mind of its own

if you take one of the bikes off-road

for example that shit controls like a

grocery bag being picked up by strong

wind it is impossible to go where you

want to go half the time when you're out

of map and there's so many fucking rocks

there's a million rocks this is a

technical marvel in the amount of little

rocks that it throws in your way that

your fucking vehicles will pinball off

of if you make the mistake of taking the

road less traveled it is unbelievably

frustrating I convinced about how not

fun it is and it wants to be not fun and

yes I can see why people could find it

relaxing if they want something to fall

asleep to this game would definitely

help with your insomnia but it's still

no matter how you spin it never ever fun

and it's by design now this being a

video game that's a huge problem it's a

fucking game not a movie but it should

have been this would be a masterpiece if

there wasn't a game attached to it this

is a great movie that unfortunately has

a shit game on top of it everything else

that's not gameplay is superb

spectacular I love almost every

character in here yes there's cheesy

dialogue but when there's this many

lines of dialogue obviously there's

gonna be some stinkers but a lot of them

happen with fragile fragile lines often

get really comical she has a line where

she goes I may be fragile but I'm not

fragile and Janene she says verbatim

everything you've heard about me is true

except for the lies so yeah there's some

like you know are I'm fourteen and this

is deep kind of shit but you know you

expect that from again

that has this much in it so it's not a

complaint I love the characters and I

love the writing it has such a

fascinating story it has so many nuanced

details to the characters and what goes

on and the certain things you can do

when you're in your private room there's

a lot of options available to you

there's just so much in it aside from

gameplay that is so great but

unfortunately that fucking gameplays

still there like a pimple on the face of

a supermodel

like a thousand pimples on the face of

the world's best looking supermodel

graphically this game is absolutely

awe-inspiringly gorgeous the settings

you visit the certain areas you go to

some of the without spoiling anything

some of the certain enemies you

encounter some of the beauties some of

the everything pretty much everything in

this game is gorgeous and its design is

flawless the villain Higgs he looks

great it's just so beautiful to look at

an absolute marvel but then there's that

gameplay there's that gameplay that you

know you know there's twenty minutes of

great cutscenes this 20 minutes of

interacting with the characters is about

to be fucking ruined what I have to go

make this delivery because some old

bitch over in the middle of nowhere

wanted to have this plastic fork

delivered to her and I'm the only man

for the job and also the music in this

game bangs the soundtrack is so great

every time a song comes on it is a joy

to listen to absolute pleasure but then

there's the gameplay you hear that song

but you're still playing the game so now

you're conflicted shit I got shit

gameplay but great music fuck

if only the gameplay wasn't here I'd

rather just listen to the jukebox it's I

can't stress enough how miserable the

gameplay is I'm not exaggerating I was

genuinely miserable whenever the

gameplay would drag on I had a mission

towards the end of the game in a snowy

mountaintop the entire snowy mountain

top area can suck the dirtiest part of

my butthole by the way where the mission

was visit one area go a thousand

kilometres to the left after going a

thousand kilometres to the left to visit

one Mountaineer I had to go 3,000

kilometers to the right to visit a

doctor after visiting that doctor 3,000

kilometers on the right I had to go

3,000 kilometers all the way back to the

Mountaineer after going back to the

Mountaineer I had to go back to the main

hub that I started it in and then that

was the questline complete it was

an interesting that was not well written

that whole side quest was not good and

it was the most tedious thing in the

world because the mountains couldn't be

traversed very efficiently

there were zip lines placed but in bad

locations and also couldn't be used

overly great throughout that area it is

I could go on and on

I really couldn't the gameplay is unlike

anything I've ever played before in a

bad way there's a reason games don't

make gameplay like this because it

doesn't lead itself to being fun for the

player it just reaches a point where

you're able to tolerate it and put up

with it for the greater good of

finishing the plot that Kojima has made

here and it is absolutely fantastic as a

movie and plugging this into the moist

meter I'm giving death stranding a 60%

there's so much to love about death

stranding none of it involving its core

gameplay loop if that was just improved

changed or just completely gotten rid of

this could have truly been a fucking

masterpiece and I have no doubt once

Kojima does start making movies they're

gonna be absolutely wonderful but this

game I just I can't recommend it what I

would recommend is watching death

stranding watch a full playthrough

without the gameplay perhaps or the sped

up gameplay but just watching the

cutscenes watching the characters and

some of the side quests I think would be

much better than actually picking up the

controller and playing this for 60 hours

that's it

so yeah

Moist Meter | Luigi's Mansion 3

initiating moisture nostalgia comes in

many forms maybe you think back on

grandma's old special grilled cheese

recipe and get a semi chub maybe you're

like me and remember super-sized options

from McDonald's before they phased it

out due to causing hearts to explode

point being nostalgia is fuckin powerful

and nothing is more nostalgic for me

than the original Luigi's Mansion I

still remember the Christmas I got it on

the Gamecube just an outright great game

that still holds up well today and I'm

super excited to say the newest Luigi's

Mansion Luigi's Mansion three is just as

good and in some cases even better than

the original so let's dive the fuck in

the thing I like most about the new

Luigi's Mansion is that they have it as

a hotel instead of a mansion which let

them do each floor its own unique theme

and the original Luigi's Mansion each

room would have a different theme or

purpose you know a fitness room a

ballroom or is in the hotel each floor

is dedicated to it the entire floor so

every room follows the theme for example

there's an entire room or floor that's

dedicated to just being a full-blown

movie studio that has you with a really

cool boss battle at the end on camera

another floor has you entering in LA

Fitness where you can go in the locker

room and find use needles where the

synthol was used each floor just becomes

its own entirely different adventure

with a really good boss at the end the

bosses in this game are super fun they

each have different mechanics some

better than others and there is one boss

in particular I find to be a bit tedious

for the sake of tedium it's a cat that

you have to chase through multiple

floors doing the exact same mechanic to

six times and I just think that's a bit

excessive not that it's a bad fight but

it doesn't change you're just hunting it

across these floors and so I didn't care

for that boss but every other one for

the most part was a really memorable and

enjoyable boss that not only looked good

but had some fun mechanics to play with

and it really is the strongest part

about this game just all of the

different places you go and how great

they look and how great the boss at the

end is you go to a floor and it takes

you to a fucking pirate ship you summon

the Black Pearl and fight its captain so

it's not restricted to just being rooms

in a hotel or you know themed around

something indoors and has you going all

over the place and doing all kinds of

crazy shit which was a lot of fun now

I'm gonna get to a complaint now because

some of the boss fights were made hard

not because they were a hard boss but

because the controls betray you

the controls have a mind of their own

and they're constantly trying to fight

you for their independence when you're

trying to aim something like the plunger

the plunger is something where you can

fire it it sticks to a surface you suck

it up and you pull something off when

you're trying to aim that plunger the

controls just don't really work they

don't lock on to what you need them to

and have you spinning all over the place

and this is where the camera angle kind

of fucks you as well because you can't

really tell where you are in space or

exactly where you're aiming so then you

just get confused you end up firing the

plunger straight behind you were

throwing it out your own asshole so it

doesn't really go where you need it to

during a boss fight which became

painfully tedious during the last boss

the last boss has you firing bombs into

a mouth and you can't find the mouth

half the times because it won't lock on

so if you fucking firing bombs like

you're doing it with your goddamn eye is

closed because for some reason it won't

target properly now luckily it's made a

little easier by being able to use the

bumpers for the things that you'll need

to aim but even then it's still not

great because when you spin around it

does it so violently and you can never

really quite tell where you're looking

that it ends up still just being very

wonky and just not great there's also an

entire level where you're in a water

like a water raft and the water raft

controls their abominable has you

spinning around like you're drunk on a

fucking ferris wheel it's just confusing

sometimes with how the controls work but

it's not the biggest issue in the world

it's just something that becomes

frustrating during certain parts of the

game but that aside those are my only

real complaints with just the

occasionally frustrating controls with a

camera paired with a camera angle that

doesn't really do you any favors with

figuring out where you are in space

other than that the game's fucking great

the majority of the game will have you

solving puzzles which are actually

pretty cleverly designed they're not

just surface level baby shit have you

thinking like a real strong scholarly

man and there's a lot of things you can

find some rare jewels hidden throughout

the world and you have a lot of

different things to tackle these puzzles

with so you'll be using

of them between the pun plunger the

Darklight and GUI G GUI G's this

sidekick that you fart out he's

basically just a cum clone of you and

then you control to Luigi's gooood you

can squeeze through gates and holes and

shit like that

so there's just a lot of different ways

of approaching these puzzles and a lot

of things that you'll have to be

thinking about when attacking them it's

a really fun game and it just feels

great to be back in the saddle again

with the old Dyson hands sucking on some

ghosts and the game is also not super

short or anything it took me just under

10 hours to beat it and I was without

going through and finding most of things

hidden in the world and it does have an

online mode but I didn't find it to be

that enjoyable the online mode basically

just has you and some teammates going

through rooms clearing them of random

ghost mobs I didn't find it to be all

that enjoyable from the couple of games

I played but it is an option if you just

can't get enough of sucking up the

ghosts so plugging Luigi's Mansion 3

into the moist meter I'm giving it a

nice 90 percent I think if you own a

switch in this game as a must-have it's

a lot of fun a really really cute and

exciting adventure and I just really

fucking loved it that's it so yeah

Moist Meter | Terminator: Dark Fate

this episode was brought to you by keeps

it comes to blockbuster franchises none

are more mediocre than the Terminator

series there's only two good entries

into the franchise the first and second

movie it's not exactly brave to say that

not controversial it's pretty well

accepted those are the only two good

things Terminator related and I'm not

just talking about movies all the movies

post t2 of suck some fat asshole but

even like everything licensed on at

videogames the fucking ride at Universal

all of them just straight dog shit for

some reason just super stinky I don't

know why they can't make anything good

Terminator related and going into the

new Terminator dark fate Andrew and I

were expecting to just kind of laugh at

it like we have with the other

terminators but to our surprise this

movie absolutely slaps they finally done

what we all thought was impossible they

made another good Terminator movie for

the better part of two fucking decades

they couldn't make anything that even

resembled passable quality in the

terminator universe but now they finally

done it with dark fade I really liked

almost everything about this movie as

did Andrew there were obvious goofy

moments as you would expect from

something like this a lot of their

speeches reminded me of pretty low

quality anime our fates aren't written

we can change our fates yahoo friendship

and the power of love and what it means

to be human nothing overly unique in

that aspect but it's still an aura you

know good feeling wholesome this shit

when it happens it's cheesy it's fun but

it is very goofy nonetheless the thing I

like the most about this movie the thing

that the thing that I think they

absolutely nailed the best decision

Terminator has ever made is they totally

just forgot everything they've made

after Terminator 2 they don't just wreck

condit they said you know what we know

everything post Judgment Day is just a

pile of shit we're throwing it in the

toilet where it belongs so this movie

picks up right after Terminator 2 and it

feels like the first Canon entry into

the Terminator franchise since t2 it

feels right and the plots really I think

the plots are really nice

I think it's creative I like the spin

they put on it Sarah Connors role in it

as well as the new characters they

introduced I think

a really good character Arnold is still

an absolute joy to watch on screen and

the development his characters had and

overall the plot doesn't have like

twists and turns or anything but the

characters they introduce and the plot

points that are there are really

well-made objectively I think they're

just decently done I also really like

the choreography in this movie the

action scenes in this are definitely the

best in the entire franchise at times

that reminded me of Jackie Chan one of

the new characters grace will often use

improvised weapons where she's grabbing

fucking car doors or something and using

them as shields she grabs a chain and

spins it around she's often using all

kinds of weapons and trying to fight off

the new Rev that's it's trying to

assassinate another main character I'm

trying to do my best to avoid even the

smallest spoilers because I know I often

do spoil things by total accident in

some of these but just know that grace

is an Augmented human who fights a lot

like Jackie Chan would if Jackie Chan

was a future robot fucking awesome kung

fu master assassin I really enjoyed the

choreography it wasn't just shoot at

this thing that immediately heals itself

you know shoot at this fucking water

metal thing it was fight this water

metal thing and beat some ass and I just

really enjoyed the action overall it was

very very well done and creative but

there also leads me to another complaint

there is a lot of action and not all of

it is as high-quality as other scenes

for example one scene that really stood

out to me in the beginning is the first

fight between Grace and the new

Terminator trying to kill Danny the new

main focal point of the story is the

movement feels weird to watch it feels

stretchy like every characters mr.

fantastic they'll have scenes where

they're stretching out like Michael

Jordan and spacejam going for the final

dunk which obviously aren't meant to be

there it's just when they're going from

frame by frame and they're breaking down

the movement you can kind of see that

along dating shit kind of reminiscent of

DC's movies back when their CGI was

really bad like Justice League their CGI

is still kind of bad but that's the most

obvious example it just doesn't look

right it doesn't look natural or fluid

it just it looks kind of shitty at times

really only the movement the impact and

everything all it looks about what you'd

expect

just specifically when they're going

from point A to point B during a fight

like they're jumping and everything it

just it looks like shit sometimes not

that it's the biggest issue nor is it

that like glaringly obvious but when

you're trying to focus on the action and

that kind of shit's happening like that

what the fuck is that is that an action

figure flying around what's going on

with the physics here just something

that most people will probably notice

but trying to brush off I know I did

because everything else is just really

cool about it when in there fighting I

also think the acting in this is

surprisingly good for terminator I

really think everyone all around did a

pretty solid job with their performance

especially Arnold Arnold is just a

fucking classic sits him in and of

himself reminds me of everything I've

always loved about movies just every

character he fucking plays I love and in

this movie I really like what he does

again I don't know I'm just a huge irony

fan Sarah Connors actress he she does a

great job as well it's just a good movie

which is super surprising to say about

anything Terminator related these days

there's a couple of plot holes that I

noticed and I don't want to point out

because I'm not doing spoilers but aside

from just some bad CGI occasionally some

plot holes and just occasional goofiness

in general there's like a scene where

grace to prove she's a robot does like

this weird insel switchblade thing where

she slices a fly in half to prove she's

the master of the blade so there is

definitely some goofiness there for the

sake of goofiness but I don't really

have many bad things to say about this

movie overall plugging the new

Terminator Terminator dark fate into the

moist meter I'm given this bad boy a

nice 80% and it makes me optimistic for

what comes next in the terminator

universe because they've set it up for

more they've completely redone the whole

universe of what's going on in

Terminator now and I'm excited which I

didn't think would ever happen again

because Terminator seemed like just such

a throwaway franchise with nothing going

for it good movie you know what a super

scary statistic is two out of three guys

will experience some form of male

pattern baldness by the time they're 35

that's horrifying right now for 66% of

men there's a ticking time bomb of hair

loss ready to blow at any point the good

news let me tell you about keeps

today's advancements in science keeps

offers proven treatments that can combat

the symptoms of hair loss you can visit

a certified doctor online with keeps and

Moist Meter | Modern Warfare

initiating moisture today we're looking

at the new call of duty modern warfare

and let me get a big complaint out of

the way right now

I hate its fucking name I hate this

goddamn trend where you name the newest

game the same name as a previous entry

in your already established franchise

and I know I make this complaint every

single time some game or movie does this

but to me it's like breaking an

unwritten eleventh commandment

it's a fucking cardinal sin I know I

talked about it with God of War the new

one you know Star Wars Battlefront 1 & 2

I hate this shit I don't know why you're

naming a new game the exact same title

is an old one and every single time

those sad lonely limp-dicked enthusiasts

and super fans of the franchise always

defend it with that pretentious artsy

reasoning oh well you see Charlie it's

actually a soft reboot to the franchise

so then making it the same titles

actually kind of poetic and it makes a

lot of sense if you only watched Rick

and Morty it's just so fucking stupid

it's dumb it's lazy it's uninspired just

sparked smelling nonsense name it

anything but a name that already exists

in your franchise change it up a little

bit anyway call it Call of Duty finger

family fingers my family I don't care

just stop naming the games the same

fucking title as something you've

already had and now pushing that aside

the game super solid and especially one

thing that caught me off guard is how

great the story is I was blown away by

how competent the story was it was fun

it was engaging the characters were well

acted the set pieces were fucking

beautiful cutscenes great but the

cutscenes were so good-looking that it

always lagged it always caused

framedrops and it wasn't just me i

streamed the whole thing live at

twitch.tv slash moist critical i

streamed daily come check that shit out

and follow if you'd like and everyone in

chat would say when they played campaign

the cutscenes lagged their machines as

well so it wasn't local to just me it's

not a shitty computer it's just the

cutscenes look so great that technology

hasn't caught up to their beauty so it

struggles and one thing I need to point

out is how short the campaign is I

played through on recruit because I'm

not playing call of duty to get like a

fucking challenging experience that I'm

gonna remember like some kind of

profound uphill battle that I come out

on top of with a sense of pride and

accomplishment I was just playing it

first

fun and I was there to laugh at this

story because I thought it'd be bad but

I ended up really liking it in the

characters but it's super short so on

recruit difficulty I was able to blast

through the campaign in just under four

hours and that was with taking breaks

and kind of just fucking around with the

game itself so it is a short game but it

does tell a good story in that time and

it's well made well-rounded and the

missions are really really cool not all

of them there's a couple really stinky

ones where it's just defend this point

for X amount of minutes from X amount of

waves and I hate that shit just point

the fence for X amount but when it's not

doing that you throw on the night vision

goggles busting down doors you know

making split that split-second decisions

on whether you shoot the person or not

of a bad person or not it's just really

fun and engaging and I was really

impressed with this story I do feel at

the end though the ending of the game is

weak there's a very huge plot hole I

won't get into spoilers but one of the

main characters does something that

makes absolutely no fucking sense given

the circumstances right before the game

ends but aside from that the campaign

being good how is the multiplayer cuz

that's what most people play Call of

Duty 4 the multiplayer is great in terms

of its gunplay the gunplay is so fun

it's nice and fast very responsive the

guns feel nice there's a lot of

customizations options it's pretty

fucking deep in that realm and it is

just always fun to run and gun someone

down but it is held back substantially

by some of the worst map design I have

ever seen in a video game out of the 10

multiplayer maps that excludes ground

war maps and gunfight maps gun fight

being the 2v2 game mode out of the 10

multiplayer only maps only two maps are

even play ibly enjoyable and almost well

designed everything else is absolute

fucking dogshit and I'm not exaggerating

what is the big problem with these maps

and why do I think they're so bad why

does most people agree that they're so

bad it's because they were designed to

favor camping hugely and I don't know if

it was on purpose or not but that's what

it ends up doing because every position

you take on this map no matter where

you're going where you're at you can get

shot by like 15 different possible spa

you can get shot by five windows that

you don't see in four different fucking

hallways and alleys you don't see and if

you wanted to check each and every one

before going you wouldn't have time

before you got blasted from some fucking

obscure window that also overlooks you

everywhere in all of these maps is

constantly being able to be seen from

pretty much anywhere on the map which

leads to people constantly just picking

a spot and camping it so playing fast

running gun playing aggressive is

punished in this game and it's the map

design that does it in the gameplay

seems to want to be fast and

in-your-face nuts to butts peel your

urethra back and just annihilate you

with speed and intensity violence but

you don't get to do that because the map

design holds it back and makes you put

on the condom and makes you slow down or

else you're just gonna keep getting your

ass extended it's so frustrating and the

spawn system is awful absolute shit -

it's so unfortunate because it hinders

the game in such an important way it

takes away how much fun you can have

with the guns and it makes it just such

wasted potential they need to complete

they need to make a free dlc ASAP with

good maps in them otherwise this game is

not going to last these maps are driving

people away faster than anything else

and it's for good reason they are so bad

I can't even wrap my head around what

they were thinking with these maps it's

just so overstuffed with all of these

angles that everything looks at you are

never able to properly move around a map

because you're just gonna get gunned

down from five windows it's so dumb it's

so frustrating and I can't complain

enough about it gun fight doesn't suffer

from this problem that's the 2v2 game

mode because it's two V twos the maps

aren't as important there with the

angles and such because it's only two

people against two other people so you

don't have to check a thousand different

spots and get gunned down in the process

you will have time to go through the

angles so I don't find it as big a deal

there ground war is just a complete

waste ground war is going to be the most

miserable experience you ever have in an

FPS there's nothing fun about ground war

the vehicles feel like you're playing

battlefield mobile in 2008 when mobile

game

just didn't even really work so the

vehicles are no fun at all in the

massing ground war to another level of

awful there's two ground war maps and

they're both irredeemably horrible the

first one is the one from the beta

that's the one that has a mountain

overlooking the whole map or the entire

other team just sits with snipers going

for their KD and phase montages and if

they're not doing that they're sitting

on that same mountain with tanks just

spraying their fucking Splash Damage

hoping to get kills that way it is such

horrid design there's no fun to be had

an either ground war map the other one's

all about verticality so almost

everyone's just standing on top of

buildings sniping down on you and if

they're not doing that they're hiding in

buildings waiting for you also getting

to the top of the building is extremely

tedious because it's 20 floors which you

have to go up individually and there's

nothing there so once you commit to

going up you're going from floor 1 all

the way to floor 20 the fucking roof

access because there's really nothing

else on those floors it is such a shit

map ground war just disregard it pretend

it's not there cuz it is horrendous you

will have no fun unless you like just

standing still with your finger up your

ass and sniping from a mountain across

the map or on top of a building that's

not really my play style I prefer

aggressive and you know really just a

fast-paced play style which this game

really punishes super hard so you have

to adapt anymore it be more campy and

slow and cautious which is a shame this

game has so much potential with this

incredible gunplay but their maps are so

so bad I can't stress it enough they're

absolutely horrible plugging this into

the moist meter I'm giving call of duty

modern warfare a 70% strong campaign and

extremely strong gunplay but the maps

just bring this down from a great game

to only a good game and in fact I'm

gonna change my mind because it's 70s

even still too high for how miserable

the multiplayer gets on these maps I'm

dropping it to a 65 it is so frustrating

you can go 30 and OH in this game get a

nuke and still had no fun because you

were just camping for it and you didn't

enjoy it I've had many times where I'm

going fucking 45 and 5

and by the end of it I just want to be

done cuz it was no fun at all it's just

a shame that these maps makes such a

huge impact on how good the game is they

bring it down so far that's it

so yeah

Moist Meter | Maleficent: Mistress of Evil

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're looking at the new

Maleficent mistress of evil it's wierd

Maleficent's one of the very few disney

movies where critics felt confident

enough in their three inches of usable

penis to come out and just openly shit

on and tear apart in their reviews and

that's very uncommon and

uncharacteristic of these pathetic worms

because usually they'll suck the ass of

anything Disney related they're usually

not overly harsh on Disney movies but

for some reason Maleficent was where

they finally rallied their flags and

started shitting on it openly and now

for mr. Sevierville they're doing the

same thing and openly shitting on it

just being super hard on the movie which

I mean it'd be great if it made sense

but to me it doesn't Maleficent's not

exactly the Disney movie that I think is

deserving of this kind of bukkake

session it's not bad the first one I

enjoyed quite a bit in the second one I

enjoyed even more so well not even more

so but just as much for a different

reason I don't understand why it's the

subject to the critics just annihilating

it it's very strange to me maybe it's

just pent-up aggression from not being

able to give honest reviews in some

movies because they get funding from

some of the studios and not want to look

bad or offend fans but I really don't

see what critics hate about the movies

it's the first one for example had a

very fun twist on a classic story we've

all heard and seen in the animated

version it's an alternate telling of the

story that's really visually full and

pleasing as well as being pretty goddamn

dark for a Disney fairy tale it's

something unique which is significantly

better than the lazy fucking rehashes of

the same story with a one to one

recreation of the animated to live

action like Lion King and shit like that

I much prefer a unique twist on it or a

new creative vision of the story mister

Sevierville admittedly isn't as good as

the first one in the department of

telling you a unique story to the

universe this one doesn't really have

the same type of emotional levels that

the first one did nor does it really try

to the emphasis on this one is more

about fear and war which is very unique

to a fucking Disney classic fairy tale

and I like that by the time the credits

roll in this movie fucking ten thousand

humans and ten thousand fairies of all

perished brutally I'm talking straight

and murder the fairies get vaporized

like they've been caught in an atomic

bomb testing facility it goes a pretty

goddamn hard for a PG Disney fairy tale

movie now one complaint I have is

Maleficent herself Angelina Jolie really

isn't a big part of this movie she's

very rarely on screen in this movie

she's like Godzilla in the Godzilla

movies where he's barely ever on screen

it's just kind of a letdown because I

think she's a great Maleficent I think

she fucking kills it so to really not

have her as a very big presence in the

movie I think is a bit of a misstep but

it's still fun it's still well-made the

story admittedly isn't the most complex

or the most surprising with its twists

and turns or anything but it's unique

enough to the universe that I still very

much enjoyed it I don't have a whole lot

of complaints about this movie all I

have is nice things to say about it

because I enjoyed it I felt like I was

watching more than just a passionless

retelling of something we've seen

already a thousand times that Disney for

some reason just keeps fucking whipping

with the whip over there with Mickey

Mouse and forcing it to dance on screen

for more money from China and from you

know the coming-of-age people that

haven't seen the animated versions so to

see something that has a different twist

and does try and be unique in an already

existing IP is something I'll always

respect I think both Maleficent movies

do a good job of that now I don't think

anyone's gonna be bored with them

because they move along pretty fast and

they are kind of hardcore they do kill

characters which I don't see a whole lot

of in movies for kids these days I mean

I understand it's a kids move you're not

going there expecting blood tits and

rock and roll flying around but to

actually kill off important characters

and to kill them off in the way that

Maleficent does it's pretty pretty rare

to see so I like what they've done with

the Maleficent 1 & 2 Maleficent 2 I

think is a bit weaker than the first one

but it is still just as visually

pleasing probably more so especially

when it comes time to the battle and the

war it's a really nice spectacle of this

red mist that's just vaporizing the

fairies as well as some combat between

them there's some like really anime

moments you know arms go out and then

all of a sudden spells are flying out of

her

hands a half expected to hear the

Evangelion theme song - come on half the

time during the fight before ever get

there is one thing I want to mention

there's like five or six times you think

the movies just about to wrap itself up

like you would just hit the climax and

now we're about to come down towards the

resolution and then it doesn't it keeps

going which isn't necessarily a huge

complaint but it's really odd that

they'd have like these really hardcore

emotional moments that you think are

about to just be like the deciding end

of where this is going and then it keeps

going I don't know I kind of threw me

off a couple times not that it's that

big of a deal but it's just something to

make note of they really wanted to you

know tease you over there with that

little foreplay that little hint that

it's coming who are kidding it's not

coming yet we've still got the stamina

it's just from start to finish I did

enjoy the movie and I think Maleficent

wanted to are a nice addition to the

established property that they're

spinning off of I think they justify

their existence and they it seemed like

a passion it's retelling of a classic

tale and I like that so putting

Maleficent mistress of evil on the moist

meter I'm giving it a nice fat 70% I

would recommend it if you're a fan of

Disney movies or fairy tales in general

I think it's a fun movie and usually

these kind of movies I think I'm very

frigate able but with Maleficent at

least in the first ones respect it's a

movie that I think about a little bit

because I did like what it did and I

like the universe it created and

mistress of evil really goes in hard and

doubles down on that universe doesn't

really add a whole lot to it as a whole

because I feel like the first one kind

of wrapped itself up nicely enough that

the second one didn't need to be made

but it had a story to tell and it told

it well and I enjoyed it that's it

so yeah

Moist Meter | Zombieland: Double Tap

initiating moisture there's no genre

that elicits more audible size and I

roles harder than zombie the zombie game

zombie movies dis that craze where

everything was on be inspired for the

better part of five or six years where

it really overstated to welcome in an

oversaturated genre burnt out the

majority of people on zombie shit as a

whole another that craze has been dying

out for the last few years zombie land

too comes out and it's ten years after

the first one and the first one really

wasn't a massive success by any means it

was well liked by a lot of people and it

had a decent enough following but it's

not exactly the most eager enthusiasts

in the world for zombie land you don't

have them like scratching at the fuckin

neck for ten years waiting for their fix

for more zombie land but regardless that

the Lord bestowed upon them that gift

with zombie land to double tap and it's

a good movie it has some of the same

style the first one did just not to that

level I think the first one still had a

lot more passion and a lot more style to

it that's probably my favorite part

about what zombie land one was it was

just hyper stylized and I really enjoyed

that but this does have it in doses not

quite to the same extreme this movie

just felt more driven by sending a

message you know what it means to be a

family and have a home in a

post-apocalyptic shithole and there's

nothing wrong with that it's not exactly

the most unique message nor was it all

that special the plot was simple enough

you know little rock runs away with a

hippie they go to a hippie camp and then

the the gang gets back together to try

and make sure she's safe and then they

defend the camp simple stuff nothing to

complain about there nothing great about

it either it's just this movie felt like

the emphasis was more on some family

shit kind of a whole movie dedicated to

fanservice like we know you guys like

them in the first one here they are

again doing their shit in this one

nothing wrong with it it's just kind of

uninspired where I feel this movie

really LAX's in its comedy Department I

feel the jokes miss more often than

they'll and I just really think the

whole movie feels dated it feels like a

lot of the humor doesn't really make

sense in the context of the movie and it

just doesn't work very well in its favor

for example one of the first jokes they

may

the movie is calling dumb zombies a

homer as if Simpsons is really something

people care about these days Simpsons

has such a negative connotation around

it as a shitty show that's overstated to

welcome in and of itself so calling them

a homer isn't exactly like the best joke

ever

and all the zombies do is clap at

butterflies and stuff you know Homer

shit it's just kind of a weak joke to

make and it's it's not like an overly

reoccurring one but that's kind of the

theme for a lot of their jokes it's like

the lowest shit from 10 years ago

translated into a 20-19 movie Elvis

Presley plays a major role in the middle

part of this movie just the idea of

Elvis Presley and Elvis Presley related

locations are a huge centerpiece to the

movie for a decent chunk of it and

that's another thing that's some shit

you joke about with your friends in

middle school all of us died taking a

shit on the shitter and that's that

whole idea of Elvis is big in this movie

just feels low feels like there really

wasn't a lot of effort to try and make

you laugh sometimes a joke does land in

more so when they go to the hippie camp

but until they get there and until you

get into that area everything just kind

of falls flat they introduce the most

generic character you know that dumb

girl oh hey guys oh my god oh my god oh

my god to be like a really annoying dumb

girl you know not smart at all and

that's her comedy is just being dumb but

not even like clever stupid just like oh

you're old oh is that your dad because

your dad would be old because you're

kind of old so your dad to be super old

your dad right because he's old it's

just that the comedy really just didn't

work for the majority of the movie and

that's the biggest complaint I have

about it when they're killing zombies

they should have still stylized and it's

still nice though it doesn't have the

same Flair that the first one did that

it is still intact and you can see they

still have that charm to it I also

really like the visuals in this one

probably even more so than the first one

like I really like Babylon which is

their hippy camp the pacifist group I

also like when they take over the White

House and make that their home for a

little while she looks really cool on

the inside it looks like something I

would have wet dreamed about as an

eighth grader they got toys and shit all

over the place

basketballs swords blades all kinds of

cool little utensils in the White House

and there is a lot to like from a

setting perspective and

usually and characters I think the

characters are still great and they're

still as good as they were in the first

one it's just they didn't have strong

writing around them when they're making

jokes unfortunately it's just overall I

don't think the movies as solid as a

package is the first one but as just

kind of a victory lap with cool

characters and a good style it's not a

bad movie by any means so plugging

Zombieland to double tap into the moist

meter I'm given this bad boy a nice 60%

it's worth seeing if you've seen the

first one it's always cute to revisit

characters especially after this long a

period of time just see what they're

doing even if it isn't the most inspired

nor is it the best sequel it's still a

fun movie to go to and that's about it

so yeah

Moist Meter | Joker

this episode is brought to you by rake

on to the moist meter today we're

looking at 29 teams most controversial

film Joker already made a whole video

talking about the drama and controversy

around this movie so I'm not gonna go

too hard in there but now that I've seen

it I'd like to at least say I don't

think this movie is going to incite

violence and inspire children to light

libraries on fire take a shit and smear

it over a cross or anything like that I

don't think this movie glorifies chaos

mayhem or violence in any manner

whatsoever and I just wanted to get that

out of the way

now let's talking about the movie itself

which is absolutely fucking

extraordinary I went into this not

expecting much the first images I saw

Joaquin Phoenix's Joker costume made me

laugh I thought he looked like a meth

addict cosplaying as a 1980s Jack

Nicholson Joker without a lot of effort

behind it but man was I blown away by

this movie I gradually got more

interested in it as more trailers came

out but even still I didn't expect it to

be as good as it turned out to be from

start to finish this movie is just a

masterpiece an absolutely incredible

character piece it's all in the back of

Joaquin Phoenix's performance it is

superb I'm not a guy who nitpicks acting

I'll go scene by scene oh I didn't quite

like the eyebrow expression either there

I certainly wouldn't make it that's not

real my immersions broken fucking

horrible acting movies enough I'm not

the kind of guy that really grades

actors that harshly on their performance

if it's really bad I notice it if it's

really good I certainly notice it and in

this case it's above really good this is

on par with Heath Ledger's Joker from

The Dark Knight and that's huge I really

just think the Joker is just one of the

all-around best written villains that we

see in movies occasionally I just really

love the character and I love what each

actor was able to bring to it the Heath

Ledger Joker interpretation and Joaquin

Phoenix's are two very different

characters so you can't exactly compare

them but Joaquin Phoenix's is just so

mesmerizing to watch on screen you never

really it always makes you uneasy but

you never really know where he's going

with it he rides the line of madness

fucking incredibly fucking tap dances on

it it's so incredible to watch the

transformation from the start of the

movie to the end of the movie it was

just an incredible ride and it's all

because of what he was able to do as an

actor now that being said I think some

of the direction they went with showing

him going crazy is it just a little

goofy this isn't a spoiler so don't

worry but there's a scene where he's

going crazy and he puts himself in a

fridge for three seconds and I was like

okay yeah I can see he's going crazy but

why the fridge is there some symbolic

meaning behind this cryogenic therapy or

whatever I didn't really understand it

there's a couple of scenes like that

where it's crazy for the sake of crazy

shit that I don't think really added

much the character cuz he was already

doing a great job of showing the

insanity transition you just didn't

really need the you know him jerking off

in his underwear to the sound of distant

screams in this city to show that he's

going crazy it's just it seemed you know

really reaching there when they were

already fucking nailing it and that's

the only actual kind of complaint I even

have about the movie it's not even a

complaint hey cuz that's not like it

really bothered me I just thought it was

unnecessary to the character this movie

as a whole is just so fucking good the

score is another thing I'd really like

to point out this movie's score is

fucking incredible it adds so much to

the already extremely tense scenes and I

just I'm really trying not to spoil

anything and it's hard to talk about a

lot of things I want to talk about

without getting into spoilers as to how

he ends up as the character and what he

does as the Joker when he gets to that

transition but I just love all of what

it builds up to it's not just there's a

lot to it it's not just you taking it at

face value the movie is about a man who

gets his shit kicked in by society and

he gets more and more insane but there's

a lot more to it than just that and I

really appreciate all the different

directions they took in getting him to

the point that he ends up at the journey

is just a really memorable one that

makes a very lasting impression on the

viewer I would like to imagine it

challenges them to think about certain

things and to do that as a comic book

movie about a comic book character I

think is nothing shy of great because I

really liked the Joker as a character as

a whole and to see him done so well and

just

so much justice with this movie is great

and it's not just Joaquin Phoenix that

does a great job in this movie from a

performance standpoint I really think

all of the surrounding characters is

well contribute a lot to it but overall

the movie is on the back of Joaquin

Phoenix and that's a good thing he takes

up the majority of the screen time and

you still want more and he has this

really good Joker laughs Joker laughs

are just super embarrassing these days

because they've been done to death

especially after Heath Ledger's you had

YouTube flooded with people doing Joker

last roommate walks in in the video you

know shit like that

so hearing a Joker laugh in this day and

age it makes you kind of want to roll

your eyes but Joaquin Phoenix his play

off of Joker's iconic laugh is probably

my favorite even more so than Heath

Ledger's he makes the Joker's laugh

fucking disturbing get some like phlegm

gargling in there each one's kind of

different tonally and how it affects him

they make his laugh like a disability

and it's really a it's really unique and

I just really enjoyed every time he did

his fucking laughs in this movie which

which is a lot so you get ready for that

but I just it's not there's nothing I

didn't like about what what Joaquin

Phoenix did here every time he fucking

moved and grooved where he's dancing you

know doing the fucking stanky leg and

everything Shia breakdancing in this

movie I enjoyed it now something I'm

sure a lot of people were concerned

about based on what I was reading before

it came out I just farted a lot is that

people were afraid the movie would be

boring and focus way too much on just

good acting instead of being

entertaining even though I think the two

can go hand-in-hand often I can see

their point

it might get boring just to watch him

laugh in front of a mirror for two and a

half hours yeah I get that but at no

point is the movie ever boring nor does

it drag in any certain parts in my

opinion I think everything in the movie

really works and keeps everyone on the

edge of their seats and there is action

in the movie there are certainly scenes

of action but there's not a lot they're

used very sparingly but when they are

there they're extremely intense they're

very very tense situations and that's

great there's just a whole lot here that

I don't think anyone will be bored in

this

but if you're going here expecting

action you know you're not getting John

wick you're not getting it man you're

getting a character piece that's all

about this really well-written villain

that you are watching fall into madness

fall into this really dark place so

plugging Joker into the moist meter I'm

giving this movie a 95 percent now I

know comic book movies and shit

everyone's so tired of adapting comic

books in this shit and you know I don't

think the trends dying out anytime soon

but I'm really fine with comic book

movies especially unique ones like this

and the boys

I really think comic books shouldn't be

shit on just for being you know Cape

hero shit and you know all that garbage

I really think there's just so much

unique stuff you can do with these

properties so I'm totally fine with more

comic movies to come and especially if

they're like the Joker and the boys but

this movie was really really good much

better than I was expecting in one of

the very few times that when a movie is

hyped up to be like an incredible

performance from an actor it not only

matches that but exceeds what you're

expecting from the actor an incredible

movie really fucking good that's it I'm

sure most of you have noticed but I

usually use wired

earphones but what most you don't know

is they're semi rotten and the left

sides wire is completely exposed so I

decided it was time to upgrade cuz

especially at the gym I think that

shit's probably a hazard gonna shock

myself at any moment and ruin my rep and

probably just bust my fucking ass open

so I decided to go wireless

and I got rake on wireless and so far

this has been fantastic my muscles are

getting bigger thanks to not fucking

around with the wire at the gym and just

overall very positive experience so far

so what are ray cons ray cons are

wireless earbuds co-founded by Ray J and

their stylish comfortable come in a

variety of patterns and multiple

different fit options and unlike their

competitors they're coming in at half

the price of the premium brands and

they're far more discreet and stylish

you don't have the little stim hanging

down your ear when you're wearing a

wireless earbud and the sound quality is

just as amazing as the other top brands

you're familiar with the newest model is

the best one by far six hours of

playtime seamless bluetooth pairing more

bass and a more compact design would you

see that nice noise isolating fit so if

Moist Meter | Code Vein

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're looking at code vane

otherwise known as anime soles weave

soles waifu soles it has many different

titles but one thing it definitely is is

a very very anime Dark Souls inspired

game nothing wrong with that i think the

game overall is very fun so let's rumble

the biggest difference between this

title and others in the genre is its

emphasis on story most games that fall

into this really put not much focus on a

story yeah they're there and they're

definitely good if you go out of your

way to find the story elements but this

one is much more about a narrative that

you follow meeting characters characters

developing solving mysteries and it's a

lot of fun even though often times it's

extremely cheesy it's not a bad thing

but this is genuinely some of the most

anime anime shit I have ever seen in my

life there's a main character named

yakumo and every time he even so much as

hears a fart he goes into this long

monologue about what his friends mean to

him I shit you not there's a scene where

he takes out an onigiri takes a bite of

it and then says oh I see you saw me

eatin onigiri well I'm not exactly

hungry but it reminds me of my friends

my friends and I used to love eating

these together and there's not a goddamn

thing on this planet I wouldn't do for

my friends I'd go to hell and back for

my friends then back to hell if they

wanted me to I'd stay in hell and jerk

off and hell if my friends wanted me to

my friends mean everything to me

friendship the power of friendship I can

see why that would be off-putting to a

lot of people who don't want to hear

ramblings about the power of friendship

and there's a lot of big anime titties

that jiggle around a lot so if you're

really not into that whole generic anime

plotline dialog and style then there's

not a lot here for you narrative Lee but

if you don't mind the cheesiness and you

don't mind some really lackluster voice

acting and a lot of points in this game

it's a lot of fun I think the story is

well written and it's interesting and it

keeps you invested in the characters but

you can skip the dialogue you can skip

the whole story if you want to just kind

of mash start through it like you're

watching a runescape cutscene you just

fucking hammering space to get through

it and that's fine because the gameplay

very fun so if you really just care

about good Souls like gameplay code vain

offers that for sure there's a decent

amount of build diversity but they all

kind of boil down to three main weapons

and three main ways of playing there's a

bayonet which allows you to shoot and

it's best for casting there's giant

two-handed swords and hammers which is

good if you want to do some strength

stuff and then there's one-handed

weapons as well if you're going for a

more of dexterity based dodging around

base shit when it comes to actually

fighting enemies the combat itself isn't

that deep and most of the abilities kind

of function in the same manner though

there are obvious differences between

them you'll kind of find yourself using

the same three abilities depending on

what kind of build you want to do so the

combat itself in terms of fighting isn't

that deep there's not really a lot of

combos or a combo system or anything

like that but where it gets deep is when

it comes to how you want to build your

character with the blood codes the blood

vales blood veils kind of functioning as

your armor and a complement to your

blood codes your blood coats kind of

functioning as the base for what you

want to go for example tanking you most

likely want something with Atlas maybe

even fighter there's just a lot of blood

codes that offer different statistical

benefits different resistances different

perks and they come with their own set

of gifts now gifts in this game are the

abilities and if you master an ability

you can use it even without the

corresponding blood code so you can

constantly have different abilities on

different blood codes that weren't

native to it and your blood veil like I

said is basically your armor with your

defensive stats as well as some

offensive scaling bonuses so it gets

deep when it comes to men maxing your

character and making a build that you're

happy with

however the combat itself is kind of

lacking in depth when you're actually

fighting mobs

there's is really just not a whole lot

of depth to it but I don't think it's

necessarily a bad thing

because what it does it does well enough

in its execution to make it fun I never

found myself bored during a fight the

only times I found myself a little

underwhelmed is during the boss fights

because these bosses have no mechanical

depth to them whatsoever you could give

the controller to your dog and just have

your dog hammer on it and probably beat

one of the bosses the bosses aren't

overly different from just a normal

enemy they have basically the same three

attack move chain they have a teleport

slash and that's about it they just

more health it's they have about as much

mechanical depth as fighting a runescape

Goblin and Lumbridge I just don't

understand why in a game that has stakes

as high as this does negatively they'd

have the bosses be so forgettable

there's never a time where you're

struggling against the boss because you

have a companion with you at all times

and the companions are way too strong

I'd recommend playing this game without

companions if you want an actual

difficult experience because with

companions this is the easiest Souls

like game that's ever been made by a

mile and that's not bad because mainly I

think the game puts a bigger emphasis on

its story than its challenge but if you

are looking for a challenge to turn that

off but the point I'm making with the

bosses is it's just like fighting a

normal enemy in the wild it's just not

very fun the embossed design I think

they're aesthetically cool I think they

look nice but I would at least like

their attacks in the battle itself to

have a little more depth than just dodge

three times slap in the back three times

then they're staggered they go down on

one knee like they're praying and then

you just fucking hammer them and take

their lunch money and poke them in the

ass with your sword it's just the same

thing repeated all the way up until the

last boss the last boss is the only one

that even has a second phase it's just

really underwhelming with the bosses and

that also extends to its common enemies

as well because there's really only four

enemies in this entire game that are

repeated throughout the entire 15 hour

journey no matter what zone you visit

the zones look nice and they're

environmentally different and fun

looking but all the enemies in there are

the same for enemies you've been

fighting since the tutorial just

recolored and that's so stupid I hate

that I like when the games keep enemy

variety fresh ass that way you're

constantly having to change up how you

encounter

attack a battle and you know get by and

encounter here it's always the same

enemies in every zone dropped in groups

of two that are just kind of planted

right in front of you with no care two

enemy placement whatsoever and you just

fucking slash through them there's more

variety in Tetris blocks than there are

an enemies in this 15 hour adventure

it's just really upsetting to just keep

fighting the same enemies over and over

and over again I was really hoping that

would evolve but it doesn't

luckily the combat is fun so when you're

just mowing this shit down it at least

feels satisfying albeit disappointing

because you've already killed a thousand

of these things by now but one thing I

really really like about this game is

the soundtrack I think the score to this

game is absolutely beautiful although

they repeat the songs a lot throughout

the story that's kind of to be expected

and they play the same song every time

you visit a vestige which in this game

is a memory of a character in the

universe and you're getting more about

their backstory I always found myself

getting really invested in that time

thanks to the music complementing the

story you're getting in the memory and

it's also really beautiful walking

around the memory because it's set up in

such a surreal and abstract way and I

just thought it was really cute and I

enjoyed that and at no point in this

game did I ever find the music to be

lackluster forgettable the music is a

really strong point in this game in my

opinion another thing a lot of people

might like is the ability to co-op in

the game you can invite other players

your friends and to play along with you

and then you have another player and a

companion so then you're just gang

banging everything and that's a nice

chaotic clusterfuck when you have that

going on but again it takes away the

challenge whatever semblance of a

challenge existed before you bring in

your friend anyway it's just fun to have

that ability to just co-op these kind of

games now well I think the game is

pretty flawed on a technical level and

there's a lot of things I feel it

definitely could have done better I

really did find myself enjoying the game

a lot I really enjoyed the charm of the

characters in the universe and the story

I loved the unapologetically anime

storyline and writing and just feel the

game as a whole and like I said I can

the combat never got tiresome I did try

and switch around builds a few times

although I always settled on going back

to just a giant two-handed approach it

just seemed like the most efficient way

but I really do think this is a good

game not a great game so plugging this

into the moist meter I'm giving code

vein a nice 70% I think it's a fun game

with a really interesting story to offer

albeit one that I think could put people

off of it big time but even if you

disregard the story I think a lot of

people will like toying around with the

builds and finding everything and then

just finding a play style that suits you

best for the combat even though the

combats not hard it's fun to experiment

with and

overall I think it was a fun game that's

about it

so yeah

Moist Meter | The Surge 2

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter hosted by me the master of gaming

the preeminent expert in anything that

even remotely resembles a Souls like

videogame today we're looking at the

newest entry into this genre kind of the

surge to now as a fan of the first surge

I recognize that has a lot of problems

but I still overall enjoyed the

experience the two biggest problems I

felt the surge faced was its ridiculous

enemy placement and weird map design

where it was really counter intuitive

and there was like a thousand fucking

shortcuts just to get to a bathroom so

then you'd have like ten different ways

of getting there and you'd get confused

the shortcuts became part of a puzzle

that was never really intended to be

there and I'm happy to say this urge to

improves in both of these areas more so

on the enemy placement like in the first

game they'd stack 50 enemies behind this

box that would jump out and fuck you in

the ass before you had any chance of

knowing they were there so a lot of

deaths felt like it wasn't your fault

but more just bad enemy placement

because like I said they'd pop out of

this birthday cake like strippers you

weren't expecting and they were all over

the place just fucking gang banging you

and it was just really lackluster this

urge to doesn't have this problem the

enemy placement is a lot better I feel

however I feel a lot of the maps are

still confusing in their design for

example early on brother Johnny when

you're navigating Port Nixon just this

corrosive swampland of stink it's really

hard to get a feel for it takes four or

five times going through it before you

finally figure out where things are

which is really frustrating because if

you die somewhere important Nixon trying

to get back to it it's just an absolute

chore you feel like a blind man feeling

his way around the area because all of

these corridors are so tight and

genuinely identical in terms of what

enemies are there and how they even look

so where you feel like you visited

before it could be entirely different

lead you somewhere else entirely there's

just so many nooks and crannies of these

areas that it's so easy to get lost in

and again there's a lot of shortcuts

which does help and they cut back on the

shortcuts this time so they actually

feel meaningful and you can actually

remember where they are which is nice

but even still the map design I think

leads to a lot of confusion but

lackluster map design aside I think the

maps look very nice I think it's a

technical upgrade from the first one

across the board and I really feel like

it's main

just overall a much better experience in

the first surge especially in terms of

the weapons I was finding weapons left

and right that I had a lot of fun with

there's more weapon varieties there's a

whole lot of new fun finishers of course

that are always satisfying the execute

get a lot of parts get a lot of weapons

and you're always constantly switching

things out trying new things out see

what really fits your play style if you

want something fast have like fucking

Valkyrie claws goes full Wolverine style

on I'm like a fucking feral animal you

can do the hammer approach which I

gravitated towards early on in the game

and it never stops being satisfying

chopping through all of these mobs of

enemies on your way to a boss or on your

way to explore or find new things it's

just the combat I feel it's just a lot

of fun it's a little clunky at times and

yes there's a lot of bugs sometimes

you'll go for a finisher on them and

they'll fall through the map and all of

a sudden you're fucking doing your

finisher on the dudes ghost which isn't

a gamebreaking experience or anything I

also really like the crafting and

upgrade system I find that to be

entirely unique in the genre that I just

have a lot of fun shopping off certain

body parts you know you target the right

arm get a nice weapon I really enjoy

that collect more of the right arms of

that gear level things up I really like

the way they approach the crafting and

upgrading I think it just leads to a lot

of fun that makes you want to go out and

kill a bunch of enemies instead of run

by them in a speedrun I also really like

their approach to bosses I think some of

the bosses are pretty uninspired and

kind of lazily it is not a whole lot of

cool mechanics to them it's kind of just

do the same tactics you've been doing

the whole game but now on someone with

more health which isn't the greatest but

the bosses at least look cool for the

most part but what I really like when it

comes to bosses is you can approach the

boss in a different way and do a

challenge kill on it to get a different

weapon and improved weapon in most cases

they're not overly great but it is still

always rewarding to pull off the

challenge and get that special weapon

for killing the boss in that way and I

think that is just a really cool game

design as far as story and narrative go

you're probably not going to be paying

too much attention to it

I found myself zoning out through a lot

of it I don't think it's necessarily bad

I don't think it's really good either

but it's there if you definitely want

some lore to dive into I find some of

the side characters scattered throughout

the world pretty interesting though

there like there's a nice little

nightclub with a deejay

and there's a dude striking a superhero

pose over the over to the side by the

bar you can talk to him and he tells you

a little story about being like a

superhero actor type dude and I think

that shit's kind of cute but as far as

lore and overarching narrative go I

don't think there's anything too

innovative or inspired in the

storytelling it's mainly just there to

get you point A to point B to fight some

cool shit find some cool shit and just

unleash cool shit and then a game like

this I think the most important thing

that needs to be right is the gameplay

and it really is here it's extremely

satisfying it never gets old it's always

fun there's a lot of different ways you

can build your character with the

implants that give you different perks

and abilities and you also have the gear

that comes with bonuses and partial

bonuses it's just a lot to do and always

fun to mix and match and killing enemies

never gets old no matter how easy or how

hard they are and I have to say I don't

think the game is over all that

challenging I never found myself

struggling too hard unless maybe I got

myself into a really tough situation

where you know I go full big-dick mode

and I take on nine dudes I've herded

them up and then I try and Bowl them

down like I'm going for a strike in the

lanes and then I'll maybe struggle

trying to do that but overall if you're

just picking them off one by one even

twos and threes

you're not gonna struggle and even the

bosses don't present all that much of a

challenge plugging the surge to into the

moist meter I'm giving it an 80% these

are the kind of games that I really find

myself liking not just souls like games

but a double-a game that is very clearly

has a lot of passion behind it I had the

same opinion when it came to remnant

from the ashes I think the industry

needs more games like this from a

creative team that you know wants to

deliver a unique experience and make it

fun first and foremost greed Falls

another one that I found myself really

enjoying I just really gravitate more

towards the lower budget titles that

have real passion and work put into them

that really drive to deliver something

memorable and fun and I think the surge

to does that it's not going to be

anything that ranks overly high on the

souls like souls like fans tier list I

don't think but it's enough that it's a

fun game to be entered into that

category and just an overall fun

experience and that's about it so yeah

Moist Meter | Rambo: Last Blood

initiating moisture to the moist meter

today we're looking at the new Rambo

movie last blood about a lot of you

didn't even know there was a new Rambo

movie I know I certainly didn't I only

knew this was coming out because I

checked new movies every week and I saw

Rambo was coming out on Thursday last

week and I was like wait that's weird

that's Rambo that's a pretty powerful

franchise and I hadn't seen a single

preview for it and I go to the movies

once a week and I hadn't seen anything

which is really surprising to me and I

know action-movie heroes action stars

kind of a thing of the past which is a

goddamn shame we still have a couple

like John wick and well yes just John

wick he's like the last action star I

guess I can't think of another one like

maybe the fortnight and default

character I have no fucking idea but

even still I figured Rambo would be kind

of a big deal and it really wasn't I

went opening day and it was in the

smallest theater they had available it's

just disrespectful to my boy Rambo but

anyway the marketing campaign sucked ass

and got a theatre for it but whatever

since I went into this without seeing a

preview I didn't know if this was gonna

focus more on the emotional side of

Rambo store any trying to settle down

have a normal life or more than like an

ultra violent gorefest type of deal

where there's assholes being turned

inside out blood and rock and roll

flying everywhere I didn't know what

approach it would take it turns out it's

a little bit of calm and a little bit

comedy both are done decently enough the

latter being much better the

ultraviolent gore montage at the end is

superb I really enjoyed that start to

finish it was a lot of fun The Kills

were very creative and very brutal which

I was very happy to see and that's not

to say the emotional stuff wasn't done

decent it was good I thought the cast of

characters around Rambo were good and

Rambo himself was all right this thing

is with Rambo his character is supposed

to be so damaged and you know he's gone

through all these horrible things but

that leads to some really awkward scenes

in this movie where something really bad

happens to someone he cares about a lot

and what he says and what he shows vary

greatly there's a huge disconnect he you

know something horrible happened he says

shit I'm real sad about this but the way

he's acting it too

so goddamn stoic as if he's not even

there as if someone was just holding up

the line on a piece of paper and he read

it it's just odd it just feels on it

makes the scene awkward which takes the

emotional aspect out of some of the shit

that happens now when Rambo is not in

the emotional scenes they're pretty good

and I don't think it's his fault or

anything like that I think that's just

supposed to be on the character is but

it still makes it feel odd to watch it

happen and it makes the audience feel

bit awkward because it's like well what

is he really feeling does he even care

and then he goes into this fucking

doomsday prepper mode where the second

half of the movie is all about revenge

and he's got this entire fucking home

alone booby traps setup going around his

entire barnyard all of his property has

been outfitted with the latest thing

well not really the latest and greatest

but the most haphazardly thrown together

contraption some code-named kids next

door gadgets hanging from walls shooting

laser beams and shit blown assholes up

all over the place The Revenge aspect of

this movie is a lot of fun it's just

really mindless Gore fun and like a

really confined space where Rambo is

taking out dozens and dozens of people

and you see each and every one of them

and you get to see all of the little

traps that you have like a five minute

montage of him setting up you get to see

each and every one of them played out

which is cool it's it was a lot of fun

to watch all of those unfold it has a

very satisfying conclusion and all that

was done well leading up to it though it

had a really major problem of time it's

impossible to know how much time is

passing in this movie because it's so

fucking jarring what the jumps it takes

for instance Rambo gets his ass beaten

he ends up in an ass-beating induced

coma and a character saves him and he's

crashing on her couch now he's in and

out of this sleep and when one scene the

girl that saves him leaves the house and

the next scene she comes in and Rambo

swollen I and cut up face is completely

healed nearly and then he says how long

has it been she says four days but you

have no idea because all of a sudden she

walks out she walks Ben and he's done

like a fucking quick change artist thing

and he's in perfect health all of a

sudden that happens a couple times an

incredibly major character gets killed

and then as all the other characters

around them are mourning and stuff it

all stops like

that in the next scene where everyone's

moved on and they're ready to just go

about the rest of the movie and forget

about it well not forget about it but

move on from it they've all had their

time to mourn they've all now moved on

and gone other places moved around and

it's all changing and it's apparently

been like a fucking month you don't know

how long it's been because one scene

something happens in the next scene with

nothing really leading into each other

it's anecdotal II different state of

mind for every character and something

totally different has happened it's just

really odd to keep track of how much

time is passing it's not that huge of a

deal I suppose because it makes the plot

move along much faster and you get to

the fucking kills really quickly which

it was really setting up towards for the

whole movie which was nice but it still

makes it a little odd to watch it unfold

in that way now I'm gonna plug this shit

into the moist meter I'm giving Rambo

last blood a 65 percent now I want to

talk about another thing I had a problem

with but it's a spoiler so this will now

be a spoiler so the movies about his

niece getting kidnapped and sold into

sex slavery she owed these and she dies

in Rambo's car but the odd thing about

this is is Rambo saves her put her in

the car and drove her across the border

to bring her home what I don't

understand is why wouldn't rainbow take

her to a hospital he knew she was OD'ing

he saw it and he's still driving in the

middle of bumfuck nowhere bringing her

to a goddamn dilapidated barn in the

middle of nowhere for no reason well not

for no reason to get her out but why

wouldn't he stop for a hospital to take

care of the overdosing problem that she

eventually dies from he had to have

cross the border he had the gone by

civilization at some point and he didn't

make a single stop to get her help at a

hospital in the area which I just don't

understand and maybe that's that maybe

the problem is with time I don't know

how it's time it passed from him saving

her to her dying on the road maybe he

was still in Mexico and he never never

got out and never left but I really

couldn't tell in the movie and that was

just a kind of big deal because I feel

like he could have saved her and

everything would have been fine

the movie would have ended right there

it wouldn't have been a happy ending cuz

a lot of bad should happen to her but it

wouldn't have gone further which would

have been a shame because The Kills and

everything were great but it's just from

a plot perspective made no sense to me

but again the movie was enjoyable I

liked it especially the end it's just a

lot of the stuff in

getting was a little confusing and it

didn't do anything incredible nothing

you know overly creative it was all

pretty generic and by the books but it

worked it worked well enough and I

really like to see Rambo in action

that's about it see ya

Moist Meter | It Chapter Two

initiating moisture there's a very

popular trend in modern horror movies

where you make them suck as much shit as

possible and they're just entirely

forgettable luckily that's not the case

with it I really enjoyed the first one

from start to finish I thought it did a

great job in the tourer elements as well

as its comedy the comedy really stood

out to me because when you go to a

Stephen King movie adaptation the only

comedy you're usually getting is

unintentional because they suck some fat

fucking asshole that wasn't the case

with it and it really stood out to me I

really enjoyed it I think it was a very

solid horror movie and just a really

purely enjoyable movie start to finish

it chapter 2 had its work cut out for it

to really follow that up and it did a

great job and a lot of it boils down to

just incredible casting Bill Hader is

Richie

absolutely fucking annihilates the role

he is a really really talented actor as

well as James Rahon son the one who

plays the adult Eddie and he's basically

as if the kid actor grew to a 40 year

old man in the two years it took in

between this movie and the last one it's

like the same goddamn guy it's as if you

actually are watching the kid in an

adult's body they act the same they

basically sound the same and they even

fucking look the same it's wild I don't

know if James ransoms the the young

child actors father or something but

it's fucking wild how similar they are

but there's no bad characters or

anything like that I just thought those

two really shined in my opinion because

once again in an area I didn't expect it

to be great in comedy it fucking nailed

I didn't think they could make it happen

twice I didn't think he could take

Stephen King's work and make it

intentionally humorous twice and have it

land but they fucking did it and I

respect that because it was it made me

laugh a couple times I thought it was

just really well-written there as far as

the horror elements go I actually think

they're weaker in this movie than the

first one and I didn't even think the

first one nailed a holder to a certain

degree it did it decently enough and it

was violent and brutal wasn't afraid to

be brutal this one's not either but

there's really less tension and this is

like a fucking three hour movie and at

no point did I really feel them build up

anything and then have it pay off or

lead to something like scarier or

shocking there were a few scenes we

could see them going in that direction

but they bring

get up with humor and the joke was good

but you know he kind of took away any

kind of suspense or tension building or

it just didn't build the suspense very

well or it was just kind of

unintentionally humorous such as like

the old woman I think that seen most of

you know what I'm talking about it's

just it's kind of goofy I don't know if

that's the intention there I'm sure it

probably is but that's kind of where all

the tension comes from is just freeze

bang kind of like a really light bang

it's not even like fully committed to a

jump scare or something like that so I

thought the horror was even more

lackluster this time around but it was

still just as brutal and still as

enjoyable and most of my complaints come

towards the end of the movie because up

until then it's actually a pretty

character driven piece you have all of

these characters going through their own

little adventures battling their own

demons their own obstacles to overcome

trying to find themselves remember

things about themselves really discover

who they are as you know a loser that's

what they call themselves in the movie

if you haven't seen it I'm not just

insulting the fucking characters or the

actors or anything it's just a

self-discovery piece and it's really

enjoyable to watch and it does a good

job with its themes I'd say but it's

kind of a double-edged sword because you

have them going on this mission of

finding themselves in what they want to

be what they're hiding what they've

forgotten and you don't really put a

whole lot of horror into it yes in all

of their situations Pennywise is there

kind of fucking it up and making them

face it head-on trying to bring out the

fear I get that but it's just not very

effective it's far more emotional I'd

say and also on these some of these arcs

it the CGI hurts it like there's some

downright goofy looking CGI moments

where you know you're sitting on a bench

and all of a sudden you got like a

fucking CGI kaiju lumberjack wielding

like some type of World of Warcraft item

as a fucking weapon coming at you and it

looks kind of like a video game cutscene

it's not believable it's just really

silly and that's that's a little

disappointing but if it was going for

silly it nailed it and it's hard to tell

because the movie is self-aware in

certain places but then you have this

whole thing that's kind of like this is

supposed to be scary but it's not and

that hump that comes out pretty hard at

the end which I'll talk about in a

minute I'll get into spoilers just to

kind of make my point and I'll let you

know well be

where I get into there but I'd really

like to get that out another thing I

really appreciated about the movie is

that it wasn't afraid to shy away from

being brutal again like the first one I

always appreciate that because in a lot

of modern horror movies even if they are

r-rated their idea of being brutal is

here's some severed arms and here's some

separate legs they don't really show how

it gets to that point or what goes on it

shows you all of that shit and I guess I

can appreciate that to a certain degree

just because most modern horror movies

are so pulse' fied just very pussied

they're just not they don't have any

bite to them at least I think in its

deaths and brutal shit it goes kind of

hard in that department and I really

just don't have a whole lot of negative

things to say about this the comedy

landed when there was elements to try

and make you creeped out it sometimes

worked though it never really felt

earned with enough tension built up for

it but it was always fun to see I think

the it franchise has a unique advantage

where I can show you all types of fun

stuff it's not locked in there just like

paranormal shit where a chairs moving

weirdly or somebody's possessed and

they're walking around like fucking

Frankenstein's monster hands out it

shows you a lot of cool shit you have a

clown just fucking with you and showing

you some really cool shit and I really

enjoyed that even if it wasn't all that

scary now at the end of the movie now I

am gonna get into spoilers just a few

spoilers for warning if you want to

avoid that the end of the movie gets

downright very silly to me I think the

CGI with penny wise the spider doesn't

really work all that well it looks like

some low-budget dead space shit to me I

didn't think that was very intimidating

and I really don't like that trope of

you know he's been omniscient this whole

time and now all of a sudden characters

can kind of sneak around to the side of

him while he's distracted slapping at a

wall yeah this entire movie he knows

everything going on everywhere and

putting about every single one of these

characters now when they infiltrate his

lair at the very end he has no idea

where they're going or what's going on

that makes no sense that's when he

should be strongest right and if he

can't like read their minds like he

hasn't been able to all he had to do was

it's like out of his fucking peripherals

he would have seen people sneaking

around to his right and maybe acted

sooner and stopped them in their tracks

it's just a horror movie trope I suppose

and

also thought when they defeat him it

looked extremely easy and it's something

he should have expected because it's

kind of what they fucking did in the

first one already they basically just

defeat him by insulting him hey you dick

small you're just a clown you're just a

small clown you're a clown you're a

clown you're clown you start shrinking

and shrinking oh no you're hurting my

feelings I'm big I'm big I'm big no and

then they crush his heart and that's the

end of it

it's underwhelming and I know that's how

I understand it follows the book a bit I

didn't read the book but I understand

that this this shit happens in the book

as well so I get it but you know as when

they were younger you can excuse it

because it's kids doing it you know it's

very different when you have 40 year old

men and women doing it like you're a

clown you're small fuck your stupid dumb

stuff and he's shrinking it's just a

little goofier and it really wasn't that

threatening at the end in my opinion

especially after you know you have two

movies to build up a final showdown and

you get it like that where it just ends

up a roast really shitty roast just kind

of underwhelming and that's my only like

actual huge complaint just cuz I felt

that was just not very good but putting

that aside let's plug it chapter two

into the moist meter I'm giving it

chapter two a nice 80% I think it is a

very enjoyable movie with a lot to offer

anyone it has a very long runtime but I

think it I think it's warranted I think

there's enough substance in the movie I

think nothing really feels overly rushed

and I just really enjoyed it start to

finish a very solid horror flick that's

surprisingly a humorous that's about it

so yeah

Moist Meter | Ready Or Not

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're looking at ready or

not a new dark comedy thriller horror I

don't know fucking genre tags don't

really mean much of dick anymore these

days it's a movie about a woman marrying

into an extremely wealthy family that

has a fucked up tradition where they

perform a ritual and it ends with them

playing a game of hide and seek where

the family tries to find and kill her to

complete the ritual or else the family

believes they'll die from a curse not

all too dissimilar from holes with the

Yelnats family believing they're cursed

because their great great grandfather

didn't carry that woman up the hill to

drink from water and pee or something in

the now their curse to make shoes that

smell like shit with bad luck I don't

remember exactly the plot the holes it's

been quite a while since I've seen it

but that's the idea they don't kill this

woman their family will be cursed and

killed and it stars Margot Robbie as the

lead or so I thought until the credits

rolled and learned that she's actually

named Samara weaving and just happens to

be the doppelganger of Margot Robbie

she's extremely talented there's a great

job in her role she's really fucking

good actually but man I was extremely

blown away when I learned that's not

fucking Margot Robbie because it's like

one-to-one it's like a cloning project

it's absolutely wild how similar they

look at least in my opinion and when you

watch them on screen but anyway I think

the movie overall is a good movie I

think it does a lot of things well I

think a couple of things that it doesn't

do well are things I can't really talk

about because it's more of like a

narrative point as well as some of the

character driven stuff that I don't

think works

so it's spoil a little bit of that for

you but overall it's a really fun movie

I think it's at its best when it's

executing dark humor which is a huge

part of this the movie focuses a lot on

adding humor to really tense situations

and fucked up scenes and it works really

well for the most part almost all the

jokes land sometimes a sticker - is

overplayed and overstays its welcome but

it's very nice to break up some of the

tension that it builds and it builds

tension decently enough I think

sometimes it works much better than

others some of them are just kind of

cliche and goofy wires others are

actually kind of creative with the clear

vision behind it and it does well I

don't think at any point it ever gets

you on the edge of your seat you know

about the fucking lactaid

shit your pants or something but it's

enough to keep you constantly interested

in rooting for the main character and

she goes through some shit the movie

shows you some brutal kills shows you

some really disturbing portions that she

has to go through to try and escape and

not get burned by his crew of Satanists

there's a lot that they she goes through

and she does a great job of really

portraying the terror and then by the

end of it I think it does a super great

job of showing you just who she's become

and she becomes like a super cool

character fucking badass and it's just a

really fun and it makes it very clear

that the movie is in on its silliness

it's very self-aware even when it's not

making jokes it understands exactly what

kind of movie it is and what it's trying

to be and it does a really good job I

don't have anything overly negative to

say except for things that are in

spoiler territory other than that I just

think it's a good movie I don't think

it's great or anything like that but it

is a movie probably worth seeing if

you're going for a horror movie you're

not really gonna find it here and less

tension scares you or very large houses

scare you or Butler's and shit are

terrifying if you have a phobia of any

of those maybe you'll be scared but

overall I think it's just a fun movie

that'll make you laugh and also make you

you know a bit on edge maybe make your

hair on the nutsack stand up a little

bit it's just enjoyable time plugging

ready or not into the moist meter I'm

giving ready or not a crisp 70 percent I

would like to go more into why it's not

higher but it would be getting into

spoiler territory and I'm trying my best

not to do that unless it's a movie no

one gives a shit about and this is a

movie I think people will care about and

should care about because it's a good

one that's about it so yeah

Moist Meter | Remnant: From the Ashes

initiating moisture it's been a while

since the last video game moist meter

but I thought remnant from the ashes was

a perfect one to dip my dick back into

it

rimmed it from the ashes is from gunfire

games known for the dark Sider series

one of the series that's near and dear

to my boners I'm a huge fan of

Darksiders despite it having obvious

design flaws clunky mechanics at its

core it is just truly a super fun

franchise that I'm very much into so I

was really hoping gunfire could capture

me again and bring out that boyish

Wonder and joy that Darksiders brought

out of me with remnant and it does I

really much enjoy remnant from the ashes

there's definitely some issues with the

game however for $40 you get a massive

game with a ton of replayability and

just a lot of fucking fun that is good

with friends as well you're tossed into

a universe overrun with evil shit and

sent on a mission that spans across

multiple different worlds with multiple

different types of enemies and all of it

feels pretty fun sometimes the

environments are really bland you know

just a standard decrepid city you've

seen a thousand times with shit on the

cars shit on the ground poopy everywhere

and then some regular enemies wandering

around but then you explore other worlds

you get some really nice-looking shit

there's even a world that reminds me of

one of the engineers ships and

prometheus as you're exploring around

and I really appreciated that aesthetic

I think the game at times can be very

nice-looking although overall the

graphical look of the game isn't the

best that's gonna be the first thing

most people notice it's a double-a game

it's not a triple-a game and I think the

industry needs more games like remnant

the double-a projects the passion

projects not put their emphasis on the

gameplay and the mechanics being fun

rather than making sure all the

characters look photorealistic with

dynamic sweat beads dripping down their

face and that's exactly what remnant

does is a fun game I wouldn't say it's a

great action game but it certainly is a

fun one especially at its price point

you get a lot of content there's a lot

of different weapons and it's all

procedurally generated its randomized so

your first playthrough will be different

than your second playthrough you'll get

different bosses different loot from

those bosses can

different weapons get different weapon

mods the system is actually pretty deep

allowing for a lot of different builds

you can go for a melee focus build that

one shots the enemies using different

melee weapons that you'll find along the

way there's also a trait system where

you get different trait cards that you

put trait points into which is just like

your level up points you put them into

the traits which drastically change

damage numbers reload speed stamina weak

spot experience gained etc then you can

upgrade the weapons themselves using the

materials you find in the world and the

enemies you kill along the way the

system is a lot of fun and allows for a

lot of diversity in what you're building

and what you're trying to focus on

although I don't think melee is a very

viable option considering some of the

bosses are unable to even be melee

because they're fucking flying and you

can't exactly like Superman out to them

and beat their shit in for their lunch

money but everything else seems like it

has a strong place in the game although

there is some hit detection issues

especially with the crossbow there would

be times where I'd put the crossbow

right on someone's tits fire and it just

goes right through I don't know if it

was with the coop because maybe there

was a latency issue but it's something

that I noticed happened pretty often

specifically with the crossbow and since

I mentioned the coop I'll go ahead and

touch on that the coop is fun it works

there is a lag issue but I mean that's

to be expected it's a lot of fun when

you're working with friends melting shit

and running this shit through speed

running it and if you're playing solo

there's just a lot of meat to go through

it took me roughly ten and ten hours and

some change I did the whole thing on

twitch.tv slash Moyes critical and even

that wasn't entirely solo I had a friend

come help me multiple time so you just

wanted to hop in and out now don't get

this misconstrued it's not because I

needed the help in the game that's

something I'll touch on running through

it the normal difficulty the default

difficulty of the game is not overly

challenging there were a few bosses that

took me a 5 plus tries but never more

than like 10 you're not going to be

struggling overly long on any specific

boss and if you have a friend with you

or just a random person join on you it's

pretty much a guaranteed one phase one

shot if you're playing on normal playing

on a higher difficulties gonna take you

a longer time i beaten the game once in

that 10 and a half hours and i've gone

back and played through a couple

different times for a few more hours

worth to really get my

one on higher difficulties and I can say

it is a pretty drastic difference now

I'd like to point out one of the main

things about this game that I had a bit

of an issue with and it's something that

a lot of you probably won't even care

about since most people compare this to

a Dark Souls type game anyway

it's the narrative it seems like they

wanted to tell a story and you have to

go out of your way to find most of the

story elements in the game it doesn't

really beat you over the head with it

and that's totally fine with me on my

first playthrough admittedly I just kind

of ignored all that and focused more on

the gameplay but I went back trying to

understand this story and it's not

overly well put together the writing at

times is a bit juvenile the voice acting

it feels feels like most of the actors

phoned it in however the biggest gripe I

have with it is the game doesn't have an

ending apparently the ending is planned

for a free dlc drop which doesn't

exactly forgive it because why ship a

game that doesn't end it just abruptly

rolls credits to a scene that doesn't

make any sense

and for a lot of you probably won't care

too much about that but it's definitely

something to take note of you're not

gonna really be understanding why you're

killing those certain things and what

the fuck is going on narrative Lee but

you'll probably still be having fun

anyway just killing shit and the last

complaint to point out about the game is

it feels really stiff which is to be

expected from a double-a game but it's

worth noting it does feel super clunky

at times especially during some of the

tight quarters boss fights you'll feel

like you got robbed because there is a

lot of phasing where if someone's weapon

or shot hits a wall it'll oftentimes

just go through and fucking clock you in

the nutsack anyway and is that

clunkiness that I feel translates to

some of the bosses because a lot of the

times the bosses don't have any

interesting mechanics and how to fight

them that what makes a boss hard at

points is that it'll spawn like a

million ads just a whole bunch of little

minions that you have to wave clear so

that's a little frustrating as well and

that coupled with the occasional stiff

controls and the occasional bullshit

where you're pretty sure you'd over at

the right time but you still got killed

mid animation and it leads to a bit of a

frustrating experience here and there

but it's not an overly massive thing

it's not overly frequent it's just

something worth pointing out plugging

remnant from the ashes into the moist

meter I'm giving it a 75% I did enjoy

the game I don't think it's overly great

or one of the best souls like games

which is the genre this falls into

apparently but it is

good experience worth playing with

friends and for $40 you get a lot out of

it especially if you're a fan of the

combat formula it's just a whole lot

here to like I'm happy gun fires doing

more than Darksiders though I am still

very much hoping for a Darksiders for in

the near future that's about it

so yeah

Moist Meter | Dora and the Lost City of Gold

this episode was brought to you by

expressvpn when it comes to seeing

movies alone I'm not shy about it I

don't think it's that big of a deal

however seeing dora the explorer' alone

was a whole new beast because the ticket

attendant laughed at me when I told her

I wanted one for Dora at 6:45 and that's

never happened before

I wouldn't when I see a movie that skews

for a younger audience like Toy Story

and there's shit there for adults to

like you know adults go see Pixar movies

and I saw it with Tiana but Tiana was

not in town so I was seeing Dora the

Explorer alone and I guess this was very

different because Dora the Explorer has

no adult fans at all like My Little Pony

and shit used to have the fucking greasy

ass neck bearded thirty year olds and

shit like that but Dora the Explorer

never quite tapped into that market so

when she laughed at me it really hit me

like fuck I really am gonna be probably

the only person there that's this old 25

years old and doesn't have like a kid or

something with him I'm gonna be that

goddamn weirdo and I'm probably gonna be

sitting in a row of children that are

gonna be laughing at Dora jokes and then

they look over at me and see his fucking

stoic statue of an old man and that's

exactly what happened i sat in the Royal

children and the jokes and Dora the

Explorer didn't really make me giggle or

anything but did those kids have a good

time I'll tell you what no doubt those

parents told their children to eat their

vegetables or else they'll end up like

that 25 year old dude that was watching

Dora the Explorer alone in the movie

theater anyway the movies not bad it's

it's it's serviceable Dora's more like

Lara Croft meets Eliza Thornberry she

goes on a big old adventure there's some

CG that doesn't really work very well

but with your child you're not there

looking for the smoke and mirrors trying

to figure out how the magician did the

trick the eye could clearly see kids

liked it since I sat next to a whole

goddamn School Bus full so it's

definitely good for children so if you

have a kid or something in there you

know wanting to go see a movie I guess

this works I say just go take him to

John wick 3 open their eyes

but this I guess gets the job done for

kids entertainment if you're an adult

strap the fuck in cuz this thing gets

embarrassing to sit through the Dora

sings a lot of songs that are not good

or like fun to listen to she sings like

a Pooh song she calls it the Pooh song

it's you know we dig a hole put the Pooh

in the in the shit hole and then there

goes your shit then you wiggle your

finger to it I don't know it's it's not

good and I felt genuinely like ashamed

of myself to be sitting there by my

lonesome but if you're a kid you're

probably gonna have a great time with

the nude or a movie there are moments

that are like decent like it is an

adventure movie they solve little little

puzzles and stuff some of the characters

aren't horrible the actress that plays

Dora I think does a great job the

actress I don't remember her name I

think it's like Isabella

monera she does a really good job with

the character I don't explorers a little

after my time but I would occasionally

fall asleep and then wake up to the odd

door the explorer episode coming on the

TV so I at least been familiar with the

character and the stick and I think she

does a great job the movie really crams

every door a reference possible in there

and yes that's great if you want to clap

and go crazy when you hear your favorite

line repeated it's I just don't have a

whole lot to say I'm just kinda I just

kind of feel a little bad about myself

to be honest let's just plug Dora the

Explorer into the moist meter I'm just

gonna give this bad boy a nice even 50%

if you're an adult you're not gonna like

it there's not a whole lot of fun to be

had in here unless maybe you're fucking

hammered perhaps if you have a child or

you have it like a nephew or something

that you're going to the movies with

they're probably gonna absolutely love

it judging by how the audience reacted

to it it's not the worst movie I've ever

seen in my life

but man it's not like Toy Story or

spongebob where there is it's for kids

but there is a lot for adults to enjoy

and appreciate as well this doesn't have

that this is entirely 100% for children

and I guess it does well in that regard

does anyone know what incredible online

uncompromising privacy and access to the

Internet means in Spanish trick question

it means expressvpn and it means the

Moist Meter | Hobbs and Shaw

initiating moisture Hobbs in Shaw it's

exactly what you would expect after

watching the trailer stupid over-the-top

fun it's exactly what you get fast and

furious this is a mint that itself is

the go-to series if you want to just go

you don't want to think hard you just

want to see some shit explode you want

to see some nice ass in your face being

shaken around a little bit when a nice

songs playing and you want to see

testosterone overflowing big meaty hands

being thrown fast fucking cars and

that's what you get with Hobbes and Shaw

and in this movie in particular it's

like some superhero shit they honestly

should just drop fast and furious and

called this like DC's Hobbes and Shaw

it'd be one of DC's only good movies

it's just like an actual superhero movie

The Rock plays basically the Hulk Jason

Statham plays basically the Hulk and

Idris Elba plays super interests Elba

the characters are goofy over-the-top

it's a constant you know bickering back

and forth between the rock and Jason

Statham you know hey fuck you man

no you couldn't fuck me with a dick that

small my ass is too big for your little

dick oh you take that back Hobbes my

Dick's 10 times the balls your dick once

had it's just that throughout the whole

movie with a little bit of family

undertones becoming brothers and good

friends and stuff like that that's cute

the plants nothing to really think hard

about there's a virus that bad guys want

to use to kill all the weak people in

the world and then it's just a full

throttle action I might complaint with

the action those it's edited super

poorly there's at least 30 cuts per

action scene until the last hand-to-hand

fight the last hand hand fight in this

movie is by far the best part of it but

up until then the editing was jarring

I know shaky cams kind of this staple

when it comes to action movies like this

but this was on another level like it

was that scene in taken 3 where Liam

Neeson jumps over a fence with 17 cuts

in 3 seconds it was that for every fight

scene it was disorienting for the most

part and I'm exaggerating wasn't every

fight scene like that but the majority

of them had a hard time telling exactly

what was going on who was getting thrown

who was getting punched and then at the

end they cleaned it up and it made for a

really nice final showdown

but the action was still good enough

that it was still fun you could still

tell for the most part I do have to say

interest Elba for a superhero didn't

really use any of his super shit when

you first meet him he has these eyes

that tell him everything about the

opponent predict their every move know

how to dodge and everything he uses it

then and then doesn't use it again until

the very end of the movie in fact after

the first time you meet him he doesn't

do anything super except it is asked

beat until the end of the movie kind of

underwhelming as a villain who's being

hyped up as this genetically or

mechanically modified human super

species and then he doesn't do anything

with it except get slapped around by the

other two dudes and that's a bit of a

complaint I thought he was kind of a

weak villain but I liked the overarching

plot of this whole group of people that

just want to bring the human evolution

to a massive increase it wants to modify

all the humans with all this shit I

think that's a cool premise but the main

thing you're gonna care about is the

action there's a lot of action it's fun

it's good stupid fun exactly you'd

expect but at some points it's just

downright lazy I have to point this out

because this shit they made both me and

my girlfriend were just pretty fucking

upset like it's a bit of a nitpick but

it's it's noticeable the towards the end

of the movie there's a scene where the

main characters are getting surrounded

and it's midnight it's it's pitch black

no sign of Sun at all and then the rock

yells and then a flame thrower a flame

line gets drawn in the sand and then

after the flames go up the entire scene

changes and it's broad daylight like

it's 2 p.m. in the afternoon within 2

seconds it goes from pitch-black to Sun

fully out as if the flames brought about

a change in the weather time of day out

of nowhere and then the rest of the

scene takes place during the day but

literally seconds beforehand pitch black

I don't know what the fuck happened

it was just jarring and it screamed

laziness to me I think the scene would

have been better in the dark because it

was illuminated with flames and when the

light came out the flames just made it

hard to really see it was going on

instead of being like a fun little

source of illumination for a little

artistic choice or something I don't

know I just kind of rubbed me the wrong

way there are certain things in this

movie they just scream lazy but it's not

that big of a deal there's two big

actors that make a surprise appearance

in this movie and they do a great job in

their roles I don't wanna spoil anything

so I'm not gonna give that away but I

really enjoyed their characters in here

and yeah I just don't have a whole lot

to complain about or to say about the

movie do I think it's the best Fast &

Furious movie no I don't best action

movie absolutely not is it fun

yeah it's definitely fun it is nothing

overly awful about it

there's nothing overly great about it

it's just a good little use of hour and

a half hour two hours whatever I don't

remember how long it was plugging this

into the moist meter I'm giving Hobbs

and Shaw a crisp 65 I do recommend it a

lot of the dialog doesn't really land

some of the the banter is just kind of

gets a little grating and really

tryharding at certain points to sell you

on the idea that these guys hate each

other but they might also want to kiss

on the lips it really kind of goes a

little too Hardy on there instead of

letting it be a natural chemistry but a

lot of the times does work to again

nothing overly great or overly awful

about this movie I had a fun time with

it I don't think it's a masterpiece in

action but it's got me interested enough

to see where Hobbs and Shaw saga takes

goes next because this seems to be a

flagship for a new spin-off of fast and

furious instead of just a one-off deal

this seems like it's going to be its own

series that runs concurrently with Fast

and Furious which I like because I did

enjoy the movie so that's about it so

yeah

Moist Meter | The Boys

initiating moisture the boys is an

Amazon show brand-new and it's about

superheroes baby and I am totally fine

with that I know a lot of people like to

pretend that they're above superhero

movies Oh such juvenile enjoyment for

simpletons I would never Sully my

exquisite palate with superhero movies

Oh disgusting but then they still sneak

out of the house late at night to go see

the superhero movie to get their fix

scratching it their neck like a meth

addict because they're well-made movies

and superhero movies are good fun unless

they're DC movies then most of the time

they're super shitty and they'd have

more fun doing anything else but aside

from that superhero movies are just

generally enjoyable and this show tries

to take it in a different direction

albeit it's still not even like an

original spin on the superhero genre

it's what if the superheroes were

assholes what if they weren't infallible

good guys it's a realistic look at what

would happen if superheroes existed in

our world and while it's not original

and attempting that it's definitely the

best at its execution it's really really

well done and definitely the most

realistic look at what would happen the

superheroes are egotistical humans

they've been told their whole lives that

they're gods and goddesses it's highly

marketed they're backed by a mega

corporation bought every move they make

is calculated they're there to make

money they are celebrities icons and

that's kind of it they're big corrupt

assholes though behind the scenes and

then a group of boys get together after

a traumatic event and they all try and

hunt and take down superheroes to expose

them for what they really are assholes

and also brutally murder them just

fucking fist them as hard as they can

and it's really just so well done I

enjoy it start to finish at first I

thought it was gonna be like a dark

comedy with edginess here you know oh

here comes someone liners you blood gore

for the sake of blood and gore shock for

the sake of shock and there's even a

scene with like a failed dolphin rescue

that just really kind of screamed edgy

for the sake of edgy but as the show

keeps developing all of this really

works in its favor and there's so much

more to it than just edginess for the

sake of edginess all

contributes the overall plot the themes

it's just really fucking well done

I found myself carrying about the

majority of the characters they're

really well-written in my opinion I do

think some of the dialogue kind of falls

flat like the dark comedy attempts Karl

Urban plays Billy butcher in this show

who's kind of the leader of the group of

boys kind of the mastermind the brains

behind all of it the scrotum to the

penis that is the boys and I do have to

say I think some of his lines are just

kind of shit it's like some of the

things he says I'm gonna rip your hands

off to shove them so far up your ass

that you'll wave at me through your

mouth I think that kind of shit just

screams like something he read on tumblr

not Karl Urban obviously I don't think

he improved it but the writers just

looks like something would have read on

tumblr for like an insult getting upset

about getting killed in a video game so

it doesn't always hit its mark when it

comes to like intimidating badass

dialogue the kind of shit you'd expect a

man who eats nails for breakfast and

then chugs motor oil

it doesn't really always come across

sound and solid because sometimes you

get kind of embarrassing lines like that

but I'd say about eight times out of ten

you're always rooting for a Karl Urban

and waiting to hear the next

intimidating line he drops to someone

and you love to see the way he handles

business a lot of it does boil down to

just Karl Urban being great as Billy

butcher he fucking kills it in this role

probably my favorite role I've seen him

in since Dredd speaking of which we

needed read to Karl if you're watching

this keep lobbying hard for Dredd - I'm

right behind you man he sniffing your

farts till the end of time to get Dredd

- out there if you haven't seen Dredd

check that shit out great movie but

anyway back to the boys I really just

love everything about it visually it

looks great for a TV show with eight

episodes it's really well produced I can

tell they had a pretty decent budget for

this because they've they made this shit

look really nice in my opinion the CG

moments aren't corny like in a lot of

shit so I was kind of expecting to be

like CW shit where the flash spins his

arms and they get like a little

Microsoft Word fucking particle effects

springing off of his fists but here the

superpowers work really well except a

train sometimes I thought that got a

little goofy but that might just be a

SuperSpeed I think making SuperSpeed

work in a movie is super hard and the

only one that succeeds is x-men with

Quicksilver and the way they succeed is

by just making everything else stop so

then

he just moves at a normal pace and I

think that's a really clever way of

handling it but the x-men movies are not

very good the modern ones that's the

only thing they really do right here it

does everything right in my opinion

occasional missing of the mark with

dialogue and shit

sometimes the decisions the characters

make don't make sense and especially

towards the last couple of episodes the

decision-making becomes really kind of

fucking dumb it suffers a little bit of

anime syndrome in the last couple of

episodes what I mean by that is the

anime cliche where a major character has

a lot of information that they need to

share with someone else or share with

the group and then for an explicable

reason they decide not to just for the

sake of progressing the plot and keeping

tension sigh you know the classic Hey

oniisan why why did you do this what's

going on and then instead of saying why

they did it and what's going on they

just turn their back and say nothing

nothing's going on even though if you

just told them what was going on things

could have resolved right then and there

it's just I don't like that that's

always frustrating to watch unfold and

you're always kind of rooting for the

character to please just say the fucking

information so everyone's on the same

page and we can go from there instead of

having to work backwards like showing a

math problem how you got to the

conclusion I just don't like that it's

just I feel like it's a little silly but

it's not very frequent in the show

overall I just find it to be super

enjoyable it shows you some

uncomfortable shit it shows you some

brutal shit it does get pretty dark

there's not always a happy ending and I

really enjoy that as far as you know the

dark gritty take on superheroes goes

that's not new or original but this does

it the best by far

I enjoyed the boys start to finish and

I'd also like to say homeland er

homeland err and this show is basically

the Super Man and he's pretty much the

evil Superman kind of what injustice did

but 50 times better homeland err in this

show is fucking outstanding a truly

great character loved every scene that

home Landers in he just controls it

he just fucking grabs it by the tits and

twists he is really a great character so

plugging this shit into the moist meter

I'm giving the boys a fat 90% I really

recommend it it's eight episodes just

really good fun it's not like it's not

gonna be some thought-provoking piece

you know going to bed and cold sweats

like man

really spoke to my soul but it's just so

goddamn fun and you really do root for

the characters sometimes and there's

just a lot of fun should it shows you

with good fights real bloody shit

doesn't shy away from dark themes it's

just it does edginess well I don't like

using that word edginess but it really

does describe the show in a decent

fashion it's really just fucking good I

really enjoyed it that's it

so yeah

Moist Meter | Once Upon A Time In Hollywood

initiating moisture I think it's

important to separate art from the

artist and in the case of once upon a

time in Hollywood

I had to make this necessary distinction

between the two because I do not like

Quinn Tarantino not that I don't like

his work

I think he's of just a fucking

psychopath and saying you don't like

Quentin Tarantino on the Internet is

like committing suicide because he's so

revered which I found super odd

especially in the current climate of

things with canceled culture this dude

has done everything shy of rape and

murder one of the actresses on his sets

for instance he strangles Diane Kruger

inand glorious bastards to get a

realistic-looking strangulation because

he didn't trust the actor to be too

gentle he wanted to go hard to make it

look right he strangled Emma Thurman and

Kill Bill he spit on her and also he

nearly killed her just outright murdered

her by making her drive a car with no

airbags no seat belt some decrepit

headrest literally held together by duct

tape and goodwill had her drive it down

this fucking stunt course like Evel

Knievel she got into a really bad

accident that she still suffers from The

Dude's a maniac so I don't like Quentin

Tarantino his work different story but

Once Upon a Time in Hollywood I had to

set that aside and look at this

objectively and to be honest the movies

still not even great it's definitely one

of his weaker movies it's not an overall

horrible or shitty movie by any means

but it's a movie that is entirely

carried by its cast it has a really

stacked cast and they're the only good

thing in this movie this movie is devoid

of a plot you will not find a narrative

in this movie it is not structured that

way you'll find a theme which is about

coping with you know changing times you

being less useful in society you coming

term to terms with it it's about the

struggle of accepting that fate and

that's really just about it everything

else is kind of just characters talking

to each other there's no overarching

plot there's nothing that drives the

characters there's really just not a

whole lot here in terms of substance

that being said there's a lot of cool

shit in the movie - I like the way a lot

of the scenes are shot I like the set

design it really does feel like you're

watching an old movie this doesn't feel

like a modern movie and even the

slightest bit I really really like when

they got

like an actual old Western because the

movie takes place basically around this

character whose bread and butter was old

westerns and he got a new role and

they're filming it and you're getting to

watch this old western being filmed

while you're watching the film from the

outside so you get to see them saying

like cut and shit in the scene and then

that goes right back to the movie so

you're watching like a movie within a

movie it's it's a nice a nice very

nicely done and I enjoyed that Brad Pitt

I think was phenomenal in this movie but

overall the entire first two and a half

hours of this movie because it's nearly

a three hour movie is just uninteresting

boring it's it's just not enjoyable

you'll have things that seem like

they're going somewhere for example

tension will start building up on a

ranch it's starting to build up reaching

the crescendo you got your dick in your

hand and you're ready to see anything at

all happen in this movie and then

nothing happens walks away end of

plotline you never see those characters

again nothing ever comes of it until

like the last 15 minutes you have

nothing no plot lines get resolved

really nothing happens there's there's

almost no conflict or tension past that

point there's just literal nothingness a

void of entertainment it's supposed to

be heavily reliant on comedy but Brad

Pitt is the only one who does comedy in

this movie and does it well he is the

only character that executes it in a

decent fashion sometimes Leonardo

DiCaprio's character comes across

comedic but that's just because of how

serious the character is and I think

they do a good job with that sometimes

but overall the comedy doesn't land

either so it doesn't have that crutch to

lean on either the last 15 minutes

though is spectacular absolutely

spectacular that was the only good part

of the movie and it was a really fucking

good part all the comedy works in the

last 15 minutes all of the actual shit

going on works it shot so well it's it's

grisly it's really really enjoyable but

was it worth the tiresome journey to get

to that point absolutely not in in

addition to this there's a character in

this movie who has a lot of screen time

Margot Robbie's character Sharon Tate

she has a lot of screen time in this

movie but she doesn't do anything in the

movie literally the entire character

could have been non-existent and the

movie would have done the exact same

thing on the same places she influences

not a single thing in this entire move

I don't understand what the purpose of

her character being there was

I understand it's maybe working the

angle for Charles Manson because Sharon

Tate was an actual figure but Charles

Manson doesn't have a role in this movie

at all he's just kind of hinted at

occasionally there's just nothing this

is a movie of actual nothingness just

hanging out they show you a lot of

movies though there's a lot of movies

within this movie that you get little

glimpses of and you get to take Peaks

behind I appreciate that but if there's

nothing to hold that together no

narrative to get us there no reason to

see these things it's uninteresting it's

it's just downright unfun and now I

understand what Tarantino probably

wanted to do is completely break apart

what a movie is cuz movies are

structured you have a story narrative

character tension climax resolution

those are simple ingredients to this

fucking stew that we call movies and

there's a reason those ingredients are

there because that leads to a satisfying

experience you can play with these

ingredients in all types of different

ways and I think it's unlimited the

possibilities you can do with those

things but to just get rid of all of

those things and make a movie where it's

nothing but inside jokes if you work in

Hollywood I guess and sometimes

occasionally something happening it

doesn't work because most people aren't

in the moviemaking business they don't

understand the inside jokes you're

making this seems like a movie that only

Tarantino and the higher up Hollywood

elites his buddy Weinstein it seems like

the only kind of people that would enjoy

this are the people that get that that

understand aah-ha-ha moviemaking humor

it really just doesn't work if this had

a narrative to hold it together or any

semblance of anything happening or

building up to something that actually

happened the movie would probably be

pretty fucking good because like I said

there's a lot of elements in this that

do work well when they're showing you a

movie within a movie it's just so well

acted too I can't stress that enough

I fucking love Leonardo DiCaprio's

character Rick Dalton and I also love

Cliff Brad Pitt's character it's just

the problem is there's no reason or no

Drive for these characters to get to

where they get to in the movie you just

sit there watch them talk which

sometimes is okay and tolerable but

other times just borders on insufferable

and can't wait to get the fuck out of

there it's just it's not a very good

movie

I wouldn't even call it a movie it's

like an anti movie at this point I

really just don't even know what to

classify this as the last 15 minutes I

think at the end he decided yeah this is

kind of sucks I'm gonna do a little

something to make this interesting and

then he didn't killed it but up until

then just everything was useless

including entire characters that didn't

do anything for this movie I just really

can't stress enough how disappointing

and just how outright robbed I feel of

three hours if you're gonna do this like

pretentious take on moviemaking at least

have the decency not to make it three

hours long at least make it something

short so I don't have to sit there

fucking finger up my ass waiting for it

to end or waiting for anything to happen

and you're not going to give me that

you're not gonna give me anything just

gonna dribble a little bit of

breadcrumbs occasionally and then slap

them off the table nothing comes of it

at least make it short so I have to sit

there for that long waiting for nothing

plugging this into the moist meter I'm

giving it an even 50% now I know that's

really low for Quentin Tarantino and the

rampant ball sniffing Quentin Tarantino

fanatics aren't gonna be up in arms off

Charlie simply just didn't get the

message this simpleton couldn't derive

the remarkable theme and message behind

Quentin Tarantino's pristine work a

sterling job done yet again from

Tarantino Once Upon a Time in Hollywood

is a classic it's not the theme isn't

that deep in fact the theme is beaten

into your skull pretty goddamn early on

in the movie it's not a deep movie it

doesn't want to be a deep movie you can

probably pick it apart and try and find

some shit that I don't think the movie

ever meant to represent because again

the movie is more of just a breakdown of

what a movie is expected to be I think

it was meant to subvert expectations to

really change how you view a movie kind

of just be this anti movie and it just

doesn't work at all maybe if the writing

was better I really don't know what

would have changed it around but it just

doesn't work it's an overall

disappointing movie I think there's a

reason why movies try and tell you a

story try to make you laugh

try and really do anything at all

besides just have you look at characters

talk to each other because it doesn't

come across as fun and

also it doesn't tease you with things

that might happen because that's just

always a letdown

that's like me going up to you and

saying hey here look at this car this

car might be for you it's your birthday

right maybe it is for you it's not for

you and then you fucking drive away in

it that person's obviously disappointed

they're not oh that's great he's

inverted my expectations he got my hopes

up and then a Miata I'm down solid work

no one's gonna celebrate like that

because you go to a movie to experience

something to feel something to be

entertained this doesn't do any of those

things until the end the end is super

entertaining and really fucking

fulfilling but up until then there's

just nothing and that's my biggest

complaint incredible work from the actor

so the acting is fucking nuts that's

about it see ya

Moist Meter | The Lion King

initiating moisture there's no reason to

pour sugar on this coat most do you

don't like Disney live-action remakes I

also think it's a bit ridiculous to keep

remaking beloved properties and a

live-action format seems highly

unnecessary but that being said I have

enjoyed all of the Disney live-action

remix up until Lion King and the Lion

King isn't a live-action remake cuz it's

still just animation just a realistic

animation instead of 2d so I think it's

really misleading that it's even being

branded as a live-action remake but I

could totally see why kids would think

it was realistic because visually it's

fucking stunning and it does look

genuinely real but I want to say why I

like the previous ones and not this one

let's take for example a lot in the most

recent one before this I liked Aladdin

don't get me wrong it didn't even come

close to the original didn't hold the

candle or a condom or anything to the

original it wasn't even the same

ballpark but as its own standalone piece

Aladdin was a really competent and a

movie that clearly had its own creative

vision on the story and I appreciated

that and enjoyed it it was a different

telling of the same story with a

different creative process and vision

that came across and I appreciated it I

thought it was a good movie and with the

Lion King I don't get that feeling at

all this seems completely passionless

the personality of the original is

completely ripped out of this one just

the bare bones of what Lion King was

it's just a shot-for-shot remake of the

original Lion King there's no new scenes

maybe one or two and then a couple

scenes that were outright removed

they're shortened but overall it is

shot-for-shot exactly the same movie

except animated realistically which to

me just screams cash-grab because this

movie doesn't even try to do anything

different it uses almost the identical

script as well except maybe a prototype

version of the original a much worse

rough draft version because it's not as

good there either in fact every

department in this movie is a downgrade

from the original except for if you want

to argue the visuals being more

beautiful and the visuals don't get me

wrong are unbelievably stunning just

absolutely spectacular photorealistic is

an understatement for what you get in

the movie I could absolutely see kids

going into this and thinking they just

watch the real animals on the screen it

is that good and it really is beautiful

I can't deny that at all that's my

favorite part of the movie the best part

of the movie but the main problem with

the movie is they were so married to

this idea of being realistic they didn't

realize what that would rob the film of

Lion King works as a cartoon because in

the cartoon they're very expressive in

their facial animations you get to see

what they're going through just by how

they react they you know they get tears

they get all types of different shit

going on with them and you can see the

personality of the character because

this is supposed to be realistic lions

don't cry Lions don't you know dance

around you know break dance throw up for

tonight default dances or anything crazy

like that

they're pretty stale they're pretty

blank faced blank expression they nuzzle

and stuff and that's about the extent

that they can convey emotion with here

that leads this movie to have no emotion

from the characters so in an important

scene like Mufasa dying the most you get

from Simba is a that's about it you know

that's not a whole lot of emotion you

get to see there because it's supposed

to be a realistic animal and an animal

can't you know go youtuber thumbnail

like you know crazy or anything like

that so you get a really underwhelming

moment where it's supposed to be very

emotional and that's the biggest enemy

here is because they wanted this

realistic art style it really robbed the

entire movie of emotion they tried it

they tried their best there's obvious

attempts to make the characters more

animated but they wanted to live in this

world of reality that it just doesn't

really work very well so you get like

songs that kind of just have no impact

because it looks very underwhelming the

characters just seem very out of it out

of place there's also the song with can

you feel the love tonight that takes

place during the day so it seems even

disjointed in that area where the songs

don't even match the visuals you're

seeing it's just really it's just an odd

decision to take a movie that's built on

animals being animated you know being

very clearly displaying emotion and

personality to come to this and have

none of that they're the most important

part of Lion King it's just a huge

letdown it's in the reason why some of

the like I like Aladdin is because

Aladdin

and work in live-action not nearly as

well but it's at least is at least

believable because it uses human

characters in the animation so you can

have some human actors get kind of close

to what they display in the cartoon they

can't get there they can't quite get

there but they try and they can get

close so it's not nearly as jarring you

get the same kind of emotions to a

lesser degree from the live-action as

you did from the cartoon here it's not

even close and there's no it's not even

comparable it's just a really odd it's

an odd decision I just don't see why

this movie was made in the first place

the only thing I can think of as a

cash-grab because kids by now probably

don't know what the Lion King is but

they know what Disney is because Disney

owns fucking everything shy of the air

we breathe so they want to see the next

Disney movie why not tell them the most

important story Disney's ever told with

Lion King they might not want to go

watch a cartoon from the 90s they might

want to watch a realistic one so that's

why this was made and I guess it serves

that purpose because it genuinely is

shot-for-shot the original but if you've

seen the original there is no reason why

you would ever choose this over the

original at all everything in the

cartoon version is significantly better

than this one and this just seems like

such a waste of resources

it's incredible what they've done on a

technical level with the visuals and

even the voice cast I thought it was

extremely good at times I thought a

couple of performances were a little

phoned in here and there but overall

that department was super solid as well

it's just so useless as a product

because it's it doesn't do anything if

this was a video game this wouldn't

really even be considered a remaster of

the original this would just be like a

version 1.2 with a slightly improved

graphics like there's no quality of life

changes or anything there's just no

changes except maybe removing a few few

scenes and shortening songs and they

also pretty much cut Rafiki out of the

movie the rafiki's in the movie for

maybe like five scenes in total he's

extremely underused him this movie

they cut out the most important parts of

his character which is I don't know why

they would since its shot-for-shot but

they did plugging this shit into the

moist mute I'm giving Lion King of 50%

it does what I think they wanted it to

do it tells The Lion King story

it tells it in the exact same way but a

different coat of paint on it which i

guess is what they wanted I think that's

really scummy but I can't deny how good

the movie looks it sounds great voice

cast is great I know people are going to

like the movie but it is extremely

soulless and lacks the most basic

elements of what made Lion King so great

in the first place that's about it so

yeah

Moist Meter | Stranger Things

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're taking a look at

season 3 of stranger things and as a

whole stranger things in general I

really like the show a lot of people

like it out of nostalgia for the 80s

feel because it really captures it well

this show is almost second to none when

it comes to production and set design I

think it does an absolutely beautiful

job capturing the time period but for me

personally it doesn't elicit nostalgia

because I wasn't born in the 80s I was

early 90s 94 so I you know I was past

the 80s time into the 90s where

everything was extreme if I do you know

you didn't just have basketball he had

slam ball jumping around on trampolines

breaking ankles breaking dicks so I

don't get the feeling of nostalgia and I

still fucking love the show but in

season three I did get some fat

nostalgia boners from one particular

place in the show that's very integral

to the entire development of the season

and that's the mall the mall in this

show is absolutely beautiful and it

really captures what pre-2000 malls

looked like where I grew up the mall I

went to is pretty old-fashioned and it

looked almost exactly like this one

eerily similar in fact and watching this

watching this season I was having some

fucking flashbacks Vietnam style to some

events that happened to my childhood at

that mall I saw my first pair of tits at

that mall in fact like live titties I'm

not gonna get into this story there's

really not much of a story the area I

grew up in was also pretty crime ridden

so it's just you know drugs and shit but

anyway it brought up old memories and it

was very nostalgic for me I fucking

loved that mall and I love seeing that

design reflected in this season I really

fucking liked that setting and man oh

man does it look great in this season

the whole season is fantastic I actually

think it's the strongest season I liked

it more than the first season the second

season I enjoyed but I thought there was

a lot of low points and it's gonna be

hard to talk about season 3 and stranger

things in general without getting into

spoilers but that shit's been out for

four days so I'm sure most of you have

already seen it so just this is a

forewarning for spoilers coming up

because these things that I didn't quite

care for really get into spoiler

territory but overall I loved it I

really did I

really enjoy the characters I think the

characters are super strong super

well-written and they're able to deliver

well not the characters but the writers

are able to deliver a really fun story

told very well with a lot of moving

parts to it and it has that really nice

cheesiness that I always like to see in

this season there's the new enemy

introduced some evil Russians that have

invaded Hawkins for a dubious nefarious

evil mastermind comic book shit plot

line that is never really touched on the

motivation for why the Russians are

trying to get into the upside down and

you know reopen the the gates isn't

really explored it's just kind of left

up to the viewers interpretation what

you kind of get is military reasons so

maybe they'll I'm sure they will expand

on why they're doing it more in the next

season but I don't think that's a big

deal to leave it vague like that I'm

sure they're going to expand on it of

course and to be honest it really kind

of fits the vibe of an old 80s style

movie where the only plot development

and plot device you get is there's some

goddamn evil Russians doing some creepy

shit with demons that about covers it

and you don't even know why you just

need to know it's there and you got to

start coming in guns blazing tits flying

off and shit so I'm fine with them

leaving the motivations vague I really

just enjoyed almost everything about

this season the only things that I can

even point out that I didn't care for

were some plot holes and also some plot

lines that didn't really go anywhere the

biggest one there is Billy and Mike's

mom it very early on they're about to

you know fuck in a hotel Mike's mom

cheating on the family to go fuck Billy

and that didn't happen and it is never

touched again outside of that episode

nothing develops from that it has no

purpose at all and it just kind of fades

out of everyone's memory I just don't

really see why that was even thrown in

there in the first place I don't really

get what it added to Billy's character

nor Mike's mom I thought maybe Mike's

mom would be a bigger role in this

season but she is not she that's her

biggest role is nearly cheating on her

family so not exactly you know

yee-haa type a moment nothing great to

celebrate with her character development

or anything but it just seemed out of

nowhere that didn't really serve much of

a purpose Billy was a fantastic

character he developed really

well and became this huge component to

this season by being a puppet prefer the

mind flair and he was more than just a

puppet because he also had his own

personality and there you get more of

his backstory you get to see him

struggle with being a drone and shit

it's just it was really a good character

I really liked Billy's character and I

really liked how it all ended with his

arc and everything very satisfied with

that and I really was caught off guard I

didn't think he'd be much more than just

like a comically evil vessel but it was

a lot of fun to watch his character in

this season another thing that I have a

complaint for is the entire way that

they discovered the Russian base makes

no sense to me so they pick up a Russian

transmission a coded message and they're

able to crack that and then locate their

base underground because they heard a

toy horse song play in the background

one of the quarters then you put it on

the toy horse and you ride it Old Town

Road style and shit and then they heard

that on the message they intercepted

having a hard time explaining it because

it's very silly to me so why this makes

no sense to me is why the fuck of the

Russians even broadcasting a radio

message in the first place everyone from

the Russian division the the evil

organization umbrella Corp everyone was

already on the same page the coded

message said we're all their shit was

going why it was going there and when it

was going there but why did they need to

transmit that over radio to the people

on the surface and the Russian

organization they already knew that

because it was a scheduled thing that

happens like clockwork so I don't much

see the point and then broadcasting the

message in the first place and also

since the message was being broadcast

from underground to the people

above-ground

how the fuck could the horse literally

miles up like this this fucking

underground layer was damn near in the

Earth's core and yet somehow a horse on

the surface in the mall was going off

and that was picked up on the radio and

that's how they were able to identify

where the base was how the fuck could

that happen there's no way unless that

horse is transmitting at the same

frequency or something I don't exactly

know how ham radios work or anything but

that makes no sense to me it made no

sense to me and it's still

doesn't I also don't really understand

what the point was of having the rats

and people eating fertilizer and poison

and stealing tools because that was

never referenced again and it all

stopped kind of after one day and that

was huge for a little bit it was this

huge pandemic going around Hawkins where

rats were eating fertilizer and then

people were eating fertilizer and

presumably all bringing it back to the

mind flayer but it was never used or

explored the only reference to it that I

can connect the dots to is he was using

it to make the humans you know explode

into mush but why does he need that that

doesn't really help him either because

he could do that himself as he

demonstrated he didn't need the

chemicals to make it easier another

thing that I thought is maybe they

brought it to him to make him into like

a different substance kind of like what

was referenced was Scott when they were

working on the magnet maybe that's what

he was doing but again that's not really

explained it just doesn't really make

much sense they just had this whole plot

line of fertilizer and poison being

ingested and nothing coming from it but

for a little while that was a big deal

and then all of a sudden it stops with

no explanation either I just didn't see

the point I don't know where it went I

don't know why it was there in the first

place

maybe Mike's mom was stealing it and

framing the mine flare maybe she's the

big villain I really just don't know

there's a lot of plot lines that I don't

think had much of a purpose and the last

big one that really comes to mind is I

don't like what will has become in the

show he's an extremely underutilized

character no matter how you look at it

he doesn't do anything except alert you

when the mine flare is nearby granted

that's important but come on every other

character has moments to shine in the

season literally every other character

does some important stuff and plays a

very big role and it has meaningful

moments but will is delegated to just

being like a proximity detector like a

smoke detector for when the mine flare

is nearby yes I know it's important but

the only time he can ever since he's

nearby is when the group already knows

he's nearby he rubbed his neck when the

mine flare is coming to the fucking mall

they knew that because Billy was outside

keeping them there he rubs his neck when

they're in the cabin but they knew that

because they saw him and be

Nancy had already figured out that the

mine flare was on its way it's just is

used as kind of just like this siren

that goes off when the that people are

already there when the bad guys already

there so it's just kind of an

underwhelming role and I really wish

they would do more with his character

because I think he's a really good

character but man when you haven't be

nothing but someone begging for Dungeons

and Dragons and only meaningful

contributions become hey guys next

tingling he's probably nearby oh you

already knew that right well you know

now you know for sure it's just you know

it's underwhelming and it makes me upset

that he is not a bigger component to the

show or the important things that

happened in the show I do think that in

season 4 season 5 I don't how many

fucking seasons they're doing but I do

think he will be a huge part of the show

but for right now I can't help but feel

disappointed with how he's developing

and that's the last big complaint I have

about season 3 overall season 3 I think

was the strongest

I also liked how it became a little bit

more violent I think that violence

really added another level of you know

imposing like an imposing aura around

the mine flare it really showed how evil

and how high the stakes were regarding

this character you knew he was bad you

knew he did a lot of crazy bad shit and

you definitely saw some violent crazy

shit in the other seasons but in this

one it's downright you know visceral it

gets it's not afraid to be really

violent or make some hard decisions with

characters and stuff like that and I

really think that added a lot to making

the villain that much more intense and

more fun and satisfying in the

conclusion so overall stranger things

season 3 I'd give a fat 90% - and as a

whole I'd wrap stranger things as a show

in 90% as well I think it has just been

consistently enjoyable very fun show

start to finish and the only actual low

points in the show I think happened

during season 2 season 3 was just

nothing but a lot of fun with you know a

couple of missteps that I found here and

there but you may disagree with those as

well either way I think the show is

fucking fantastic that's it

so yeah

Moist Meter | Midsommar

initiating moisture seeing mid Samara

was a genuine waste of time and it

actually sucks saying that because

hereditary is what I consider one of the

best horror movies of the last decade

and this is a movie from the same

visionary that brought us that but

midsummer is just a fucking stinker it

from start to finish it's just bad the

best parts of this movie are the

cinematography which is absolutely

spectacular the cinematography is superb

and the acting all of the characters are

really well portrayed and I actually

cared about the majority of the cast

those are the only two good things about

this movie everything else just doesn't

land it tries to tackle themes of like

grief and relationships however in terms

of grief the grief portion happens in

the first 20 minutes and then it's

forgotten

immediately it's not really woven

throughout the plot at least not

effectively it just really misses on all

of the themes it goes for and that's not

even that big of a deal in the grand

scheme of this movie in terms of its

problems because everything else fucking

sucks too about it

the movie is over it's around two and a

half hours and I'd say at least an hour

and a half of that runtime is spent

either sitting down standing still or

walking in slow motion that is the

majority of every single scene in this

movie it is unbearably slow and I'm fine

with slow movies I love the tension

building shit but in this movie the

majority of the scenes are awkwardly

sitting around a table waiting for

someone to eat so you have all these

characters are sitting there looking at

each other looking back and forth and

looking blankly and as an audience

member it's there to try and build

tension like oh what's gonna happen once

the tension gonna break what's gonna

happen and then nothing happens that's

the big surprise nothing happens that's

the payoff it just fucking dragged out

and this movies marketed is a horror

movie and that's a criminal offense this

is not a horror movie nor does it want

to be in any part when it tries to do

something that even looks like it's

inspired by horror it's done off screen

everything that could even be

misconstrued as an attempt to unnerve

you or be disturbing is done off camera

what this movie does do and I'm gonna

give away this scene I hope it does not

going to be considered a spoiler what

this movie does do is make you laugh at

how bad it's attempts at unnerving

you are the last 30 minutes maybe even

40 minutes no exaggeration were spent in

tears of laughter from my audience at

the movie theater I was laughing pretty

fucking hard to let me paint the scene

for you a scene from the last 30 or 40

minutes there's two people having sex in

front of them standing around them in

like a fucking football huddle going

over plays are naked women chanting it's

an acapella of sex as two people fuck on

the floor and as they're having sex the

acapella turns from singing and chanting

into an up-close-and-personal singing

into the man's face as he's fucking the

girl once that's over they then begin

moaning in different harmonies a moaning

acapella when that's done one of the

women starts pushing his ass cheeks so

it gets deeper in the girl's vagina and

this scene goes on for no joke at least

10 minutes of uninterrupted just

goofiness

and I believe it's there to make it like

as an unnerving thing like all men this

is this is a you know the big payoff

this is the crazy shit that's going on

look how crazy this cult is how

disturbing but what actually happens is

just a really comedic ten minutes that

you're gonna spend either smiling or

just feeling really embarrassed I felt

fucking embarrassed watching this movie

a lot of the time and in the second that

scenes over it goes into another goofy

scene where the dudes running around

naked with his penis flopping everywhere

like the pendulum and a grandfather

clock and then he runs into a barn and

sees something spooky and then you know

it goes from there and just stays bad

the whole movie just doesn't land

nothing in this movie works at all the

cult shit I love the concept and I like

what the movie I think I understand what

the movie wanted to accomplish but it

doesn't even come close you get like

this pseudo comedy boring piece of shit

that in no aspects succeeds in where it

needed to or wanted to another thing I

can compliment those the sound I really

appreciated the sound when it wasn't

just moaning I appreciated that that

worked pretty well but again there's

just not very many positives I can give

to this movie it is so boring

everything drags so long you're waiting

for something anything anything at all

even remotely interesting to happen and

it never does but then you get like 30

or 40 minutes of goofs and the giggles

so I guess that's something

but men it's just it's it's just not

good it's not even like a deep movie

either there's really like all the

metaphors and symbolism it wants the hit

pretty much hit you over the head with

it there's nothing to you know deep

about it that you could pick apart and

really digest and come up with your own

fan theories cuz you're gonna pretty

much get it I think for the most part as

a general audience member it's not

really a finger it's just a straight

fucking stinker it's just not a good

movie and I'm so disappointed which is

why I'm ripping into it kind of hard

because hereditary was fantastic it was

a great movie until the last 10 minutes

where I felt it kind of fell flat but

really as a whole the movie was

fantastic

and I think it's a little unfair to

compare works even if it's from the same

visionary but in this case I can't help

but draw the comparisons because it has

a lot of the same fun cinematography

hereditary had and had a lot of the

great performances that you got in

hereditary and it just doesn't even come

close to even being in the same ballpark

as that movie

it's just bad it bafflingly bad like

even like from if you can pick out plot

holes to like the narrative doesn't work

like a traumatic thing happens to the

main character in the beginning and then

that's the end of it completely forgets

that ever happens at no point has it

ever really brought up throughout the

rest of the movie like it's just so much

wrong with this movie I wouldn't

recommend it at all it's a genuine waste

of time

plugging this shit into the moist meter

I'm giving midsummer a 25% I like the

the creative cinematography I like that

it's not just standard boring shots it's

framed beautifully I also really enjoyed

the characters the performances from the

actors those were second to none and the

sound Department kind of killed it as

well but the movie as a whole piece a

whole product is just not good it's like

offensively not good if you're a fan of

hereditary and that's unfortunate but

that's that's what it is

not really we're seeing that's it so

yeah

Moist Meter | Spider-Man: Far From Home

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're taking a look at

spider-man far from home it's another

superhero movie which means another

couple thousand redditors with their

pretentious fart smelling tendencies

saying superhero fatigue is setting in I

swear to God this time like fucking

Doomsday Preppers holding up signs on

the street for Supergirl fatigue it's

coming the end is nigh but as long as

the movie still get made as good as they

are it's probably not gonna set in for

quite a while the only really bad

superhero movie I can think of off the

top of my head from the Marvel Universe

is ant-man and the wasp that won gargled

some filthy butthole but aside from that

Marvel movies are just so goddamn well

done

and spider-man far from home is no

exception it is extraordinary I really

liked it in fact it's probably one of my

favorite ones to be honest with you I

think the villain in this movie is

second only to Thanos in the super hero

villain world

I fucking love the villain and it's not

because he had like a relatable goal or

goals that you really sympathized with

her character you really even cared

about but he was just so fucking cool

and Jake Gyllenhaal was so good as the

character I loved it

it was just really amazing the visuals

they were able to accompany with this

character the way they executed along

the scenes involving the character

everything about him was amazing and the

ending to this movie is extraordinary it

got me so goddamn excited I can't talk

about it because it is a spoiler but the

ending of this movie had me and the

whole goddamn theater excited and that

doesn't really happen I you know I like

superhero movies I think they're fun but

I never get like all giddy you know dick

in hand ready to ejaculate but when the

movie ends and you see you know you sit

through a little bit of the credits

you're rewarded with something fucking

great that I think most people that are

familiar with superheroes and shit can

really appreciate and I really just love

the way that concluded it the whole

movie though was really good the comedy

lands per usual with most Marvel movies

it's it's really well executed in the

comm unit apartment it tells a cute

little story as well Peter Parker Tom

Holland he's just fucking great as

spider-man I really enjoy him it really

there's just no bad characters there's

really no bad moments in the movie the

only complaints I have are

picky ones about the story because the

stories it's kind of silly like a lot of

the decisions from the characters don't

make sense a lot of the scenes don't

make sense the story doesn't flow all

that well because a lot of it just

doesn't make sense you have to suspend

your disbelief you have this the whole

thing is about a field trip stretched

over an adventure where a lot of bad

shit's happening and yet for some reason

the adventure still continues despite if

it being in the real world you know you

need fucking an entire city getting

destroyed it travel would probably be

shut down and since it's a bunch of kids

on a field trip the parents are probably

want the kids home you know you just had

a goddamn demon destroy a city a literal

act of God and manifestation of

destruction destroy a city your parents

are probably don't want you to call the

vacation short but yet it still

continues over the course of a bunch of

different locations a lot of the

decisions from the characters again that

I can't touch on don't really make sense

to me there's this like level of trust

that was never established as to why

some of these characters are so trusting

of one another it's it's hard to explain

without getting into spoilers and I do

try and avoid them but that's the

biggest complaint I'd have is just that

this story is kind of nonsensical and a

lot of it's set up for jokes I imagine

and because it kind of pokes fun at how

ridiculous it is there's a scene where

Peter Parker gets on a train and all of

a sudden he's like 3,000 miles away from

where he started in like the blink of an

eye and they use that for a conduit for

jokes and I guess that works too but

it's just kind of silly from a narrative

perspective and the only other issue I

have with the movies I really think

Spiderman was kind of lame in like the

first two or three fights he didn't

really do anything he kind of just got

his ass cheeks smack done by the enemies

he didn't really impress me and he has

been impressive like spider-man is a

very really fun character to watch in

the action scenes in all the previous

movies and it was really underwhelming

in the beginning he just kind of you

know tossed a pebble he'd throw a little

road sign at the monster I mean that's

kind of underwhelming you know what I

mean but at the end of the movie he

really pops the fuck off the the last

fight scene with the main villain is

really really fun to watch I enjoyed

that a lot really everything about the

last 30 minutes of the movie I was just

giddy about I really really liked it a

lot

the movies definitely worth seeing I

think it's very fucking good plugging

this shit into the moist meter giving

spider-man far from home a nice 90

percent I really like it I know a lot of

you kind of scoff at superhero movies

but they're just really well-made

they're really well done Comedy Works

and all of them the action works and all

of them they have good stories they keep

setting themselves up for a really

interesting story narrative perspective

I think it's hard to not like them you

can pretend you don't but when you see

one it's always enjoyable I really

enjoyed it I thought it was a lot of fun

that's about it so yeah

Moist Meter | Annabelle Comes Home

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're looking at the newest

conjuring movie Annabelle comes home now

I didn't know this but I just looked it

up Warner Bros was locked at a 900

million dollar lawsuit with the person

who originally wrote the stories that

the conjuring is based off of and the

only way Warner Bros was going to avoid

paying 900 million dollars to this guy

for copyright shit was if they proved

ghosts were real and I didn't realize

this but they wrapped it up in 2017 at

the end of it and I had no fucking idea

because I was waiting for this like

super team power up like Marvel Avengers

in game style where they bring in Zach

from Ghost Adventures Zach big dick

being on the demonology guy with Ghost

Adventures and bring them all together

to prove ghosts were real so they'd have

to pay nearly a billion dollars but it

turns out they ended up settling out of

court which is the most underwhelming

conclusion to a nine hundred million

dollar lawsuit where ghosts being proven

real was on the line it's just so

fucking upsetting that I was really

disappointed this entire segment here is

unrelated to Annabelle comes home

because the movie doesn't talk about it

unfortunately but I just thought that

was so interesting because that lawsuit

I was really looking forward to seeing

how they tackled the ghost thing but

they ended up not doing it they didn't

bring in Dib from invader zim or

anything they just settled it out of

court which is super fucking boring that

should be a crime in and of itself

anyway Annabelle comes home it's not bad

I don't think in either I don't think

there's really any bad movies in the

conjuring franchise except for the nun

the nun was just so fucking boring but

this isn't this movie's good I think the

conjuring movies are always just fun for

the time you're watching them nothing

special about them nothing wildly

creative but executed decently enough

the characters in this movie I actually

really liked i thought bob was a really

strong character

Danijela as well I thought the

characters because it wasn't focused on

just like the main to warns I actually

thought the characters I hadn't here

were really fun to watch with a good

dynamic and I also liked this story

where Daniella goes into the Warrens

house while the littleness girl is being

babysat by her friend and she starts

touching shit and releasing all types of

spirits and then they have to battle all

types of different spirits it's like a

scooby-doo episode in a certain sense

and it's it's fun I like

plotline but it's just so silly and

nonsensical with these horror movies

when you start to break them down

because at every step it seems like the

demons and evil spirits want you to

succeed for example in this movie

they're trying to get the Annabelle doll

back in the case and literally the

entire movie is the demons leading them

to the Annabelle doll and letting them

take the Annabelle doll multiple times

for example Mary Ellen one of the main

characters comes face to face with a

demon with an evil spirit that's killed

a bunch of people and wants to kill her

and she just gets the Annabelle doll

from it and walks away they just let

that should happen they're much more

invested in making loud noises

occasionally than actually stopping them

from being sealed again I just don't

really get that in horror movies the

conjuring does this shit all the time

they have so many opportunities to just

stop them or kill the people and they

just let them go in this movie it's just

insane how many times that happens a

fucking demon comes face to face with

the little girl and then just lets her

leave literally like chokeholds her and

then just lets her leave it's just silly

it's just really dumb I don't know why

the demons are actively trying to get

fucked I don't really understand they're

not really there to preserve themselves

they're just there to make loud noises

when it's quiet and that's what this

movie relies on much like all the other

conjuring movies it's not great at

building tension but it does try there's

also a really goofy samurai armor spirit

which is just really dumb it's just more

comical than scary but again the main

focus is on jump scares so when it gets

quiet something will fall over make a

loud noise and you go but it even that's

not super effective in this movie they

don't do it overly well the guy next to

me fell asleep like two or three times

and was snoring which was super fuckin

disruptive and I hate that kind of

behavior if you're a god damn tired just

leave but I mean it still illustrates

that it wasn't great with its horror if

you couldn't even keep the old man next

to me from falling asleep and choking on

his own spit it wasn't a bad movie

though like I said I did enjoy it and I

really I didn't regret my time with it I

do think when it did try and build

tension it didn't land most of the time

but when it did I was satisfied with it

I also really liked all of the different

spirits and all the different conduits

for evil that were in there I liked that

aspect I thought that was well

done and yeah it wasn't a horrible movie

it wasn't great just a pretty standard

average horror movie for the modern age

plugging this shit into the moist meter

I'm giving Annabelle comes home a crisp

50% beautifully average nothing great

about it nothing awful about it

nothing to really regret when seeing it

kind of fun that's about it so yeah

Moist Meter | Child's Play

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter we're looking at the new Chucky

movie child's play

Chucky as a concept is one of the very

few horror concepts that genuinely

unnerved me growing up and even to this

day it's there's still some remnant oh

yeah it's kind of a creepy idea just

that fucking haunted killer doll shit

dolls are scary man and as a kid I had a

bunch of like dolls that I'd get his

gifts like a baby and stuff and those

dolls I'd always have to like

second-guess like is he spying on me is

there a knife and that dolls I asshole

or something that's not stuffing that's

probably blood all because of the whole

idea of Chucky so although I never

watched them growing up the Chucky

movies had a profound effect on what I

found scary at the time and I'm actually

happy to say this movie is actually

pretty decent it is a good slasher movie

I thought I'd just be a cash grab going

off with a Chucky name just like I

thought Toy Story 4 would be a cash grab

neither one of them seemed to be this

one justifies its existence it's a fun

movie it does things pretty differently

and pretty creatively I had a good time

with it

the only complaints I have about the

movie or just the ending is pretty

anticlimactic there's some shit in here

that's just a little too goofy to

believe it's just and I understand he's

opposed to suspend this belief but they

said they spend like a decent portion of

time showing that Chucky is like a

lumbering fucking idiot when it comes to

getting from point A to point B he walks

like four key from Toy Story 4 for some

of the movie and then towards the end of

the movie he's sprinting around faster

than a fucking speeding bullet he's like

the flash but I mean it is a good thing

because it'd be kind of boring and a

little underwhelming if you're being

hunted by Chucky to have him kind of

like penguin walking his way towards you

like he was at the beginning of the

movie so it's good that he somehow

learned how to get around like a fucking

cheetah but never really a progression

to it he just all of a sudden he knows

how to turn into the shadows and sprint

around really quick and slash at ankles

with a knife which is fine all the

character performances were pretty good

throughout especially from the younger

actors I thought they did a pretty

decent job

no really great stand out characters or

anything like that except for Mark

Hamill voicing Chucky but again a fun

slasher movie the death senator creative

and gore

they didn't really pull any punches

there some of the humor the dark humor

lands pretty well and I didn't expect

that I thought it'd be kind of lame

shoehorned and shit but it does a good

job with dark humor and I also really

liked how Chucky becomes evil and this

isn't a spoiler it happens literally

immediately it's just a overworked man

turns on the evil switch for some reason

all of the Chucky models the Buddy dolls

come with an evil parameter that's by

default turned off and all you had to do

is change the value from evil no to evil

equals yes and then they become evil so

I mean that was kind of goofy fun really

this is the whole movie is fun I don't

think it's a great movie or anything

like that but I think it's a very fun

and good slasher movie that'll probably

have you smiling it's not gonna have you

scared it's not scary and I don't think

it even really tries to be there's like

two attempts at a jump scare and then

maybe one or two scenes where it tries

to build up tension but then the rest of

it's like dark humor comedy slasher

kills and stuff like that

and that's when it's at its best for

sure so plugging this shit into the

moist meter I'm giving childsplay

a 70% I enjoyed it have very few

complaints by no means do I think it's a

really good horror movie or anything

like that it's a very fun slasher movie

though that I think most people will be

satisfied checking out as fans of the

Chucky franchise I think it does well

enough on its own to justify this soft

reboot and it's a it's a good movie I

enjoyed it so yeah

Moist Meter | Toy Story 4

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're looking at the new toy

story toy story for a movie I felt

didn't need to be made I honestly

couldn't stand the marketing for it

either there was like fucking 50 little

teaser trailers where the gang holds

hands and falls then like the 30-second

clips of one or two jokes from key and

Peele I didn't care for that and it

really struck me is just going to be a

cash grab on the goodwill of the

franchise however after seeing Toy Story

4 I absolutely fucking loved it

absolutely loved it start to finish I

think the strongest part of this movie

is a tumor I don't know what's changed

but this is by far the best in terms of

comedy in the series and probably one of

the best animated comedies I've seen

since like Lego Batman maybe this might

be even better I don't know the comedy

really hit with me and maybe it's just

cuz I love Toy Story so much but man I

fucking love some of the jokes they told

in here and Keanu Reeves character mr.

kaboom is the best sidekick character to

be introduced into the franchise

absolutely every scene with him in it is

fucking great an awesome character and I

love you Keanu Reeves you know that if

you're watching this you know I love you

Keanu please come shake my hand or

something I'll give you like an

over-the-pants hand job if you want

great movie great character and the

humor it just lands every single time

key and Peele I thought we're gonna be

annoying characters even though I like

them as actors I thought they'd overplay

their stick but they did really well

their characters were really fun

on-screen they're plush rush it wasn't

overused it worked well I really just

enjoyed everything about this movie

visually its Pixar you know it's gonna

be fucking breathtaking real top-notch

shit and it is this one even more so

than some of their other movies they

tell you they show you a lot of really

cool scenes and scenery and shit like

that the villain is a really cool

villain not just like a comically evil

one a one that a lot of people could

relate to it's just the whole movie kind

of tugs on your heartstrings a little

bit but not as much as the previous

entries this one's a lot less

large-scale a lot more character focused

and doesn't really get as sad or tear

jerky as Toy Story

for example but it definitely does have

its emotional moments I really like the

way Woody's art concludes though I do

have to say I don't really know for sure

if this movie adds a lot to the

characters we already know and love they

dumb Buzz Lightyear down quite a bit

which is fine because they make him more

of a comedic character that still does

cool shit and is still a good friend of

woody but they do make him like

significantly stupider than previous

Buzz Lightyear's and that's not really a

complaint just what I'm saying is I

don't know if it really adds enough to

the characters to justify coming back to

the franchise after how great Toy Story

three concluded absolutely loved that

conclusion a really touching one that I

feel most people felt something during

this one doesn't have moments like that

but most people will probably relate a

lot to the villains struggles and stuff

like that it's a very humanized villain

now like a comically Evil One or

anything like that

the main new character introduced is

four key made by Bonnie and I really

wasn't expecting to like this character

but I absolutely loved this character it

was a really strong character that I

actually had some dark themes

surrounding it and I don't use dark in

like the same way that people talk about

shitty DC movies that attempt to be dark

and gritty I mean like the actual

characters it's kind of like a deep one

kind of on a different level than most

characters in an animated children's

movie at least in my personal opinion I

was expecting some Frankenstein doodle

bob thing but I actually got a really

enjoyable and pretty pretty deep

character that I really appreciated so

fuck yeah just an overall positive

experience with this movie and I just

really enjoyed it the only complaint

that I have at all is I think the ending

was a little bit rushed there you know

you spend 20 years with these characters

and then it all kind of ends in three

minutes

with the characters together it's just I

don't want to spoil anything but I think

it's just most people will probably get

the impression it was rushed as well and

that's kind of a shame but it's still a

very nice conclusion very satisfying it

was nice to see Bo Peep come back and

it's just a really enjoyable movie and

I'm glad it got made even if it wasn't

totally necessary or adds a whole lot to

the lore also I'm extremely fucking

greasy right now I can see that on the

according here so I apologize for that

let's just go ahead and plug this shit

into the moist meter

I'm giving Toy Story for a phat 90

percent a really good movie a really

really good movie that I think concludes

the Toy Story franchise I'm not sure I

don't see how they could continue it

from here but you never really know

super fucking good that's it so yeah

Moist Meter | Men In Black: International

this episode was brought to you by

hosting uh I loved the original men in

black and I'm in the small group of

people that also enjoyed men in black -

I didn't think men in black 3 was all

that strong but again not bad

so men and black international I wanted

to be good it's not very good Chris

Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson share the

screen again you'll know them from thor

ragnarok and this movies basically thor

ragnarok and black but significantly

worse in every single category

imaginable in fact the only thing it has

in common with thor ragnarok is those

same two actors are in this movie and

they still have great chemistry that's

the only compliment I really have for

this movie Chris Hemsworth and Tessa

they have good chemistry on-screen but

the writing in this movie is so bad

you're not going to appreciate it or

care at all the comedy attempts in this

movie are really bad it the humor in

this movie just doesn't land and almost

no one in the theater was laughing and

this movie tries really hard with like

rapid-fire attempts at making you giggle

and you know side-splitting comedy but

at no point will you even crack a smile

I imagine it's just not good this feels

like a really passionless attempt at

making a min and black movie like they

knew what elements made men in black and

they just kind of wanted to try the same

thing very haphazardly throw it together

with no actual care so like they knew

jokes needed to be in there but they

didn't feel like actually writing jokes

so they just came up with the most

obvious bullshit attempts at something

that could almost be misconstrued as

humor and threw it in here it's just

really a shame because Chris Hemsworth

is really good at comedy as we've seen

in Thor Ragnarok and Thor as a character

in general and here he doesn't get to

utilize that at all despite that being

his entire character in this movie his

whole character is being this silly

goofy party hard comedy wisecracker and

none of his jokes are entertaining and

even the slightest it's just really bad

the action is also shit visually the

movies pretty good I like a lot of the

weapons they show the vehicles and the

scenery I like some of that but the

action is really bad because the action

is kind of stand still and shoot like

playing a time crisis stand-up arcade

game at Dave & Buster's

there's really no depth to it there's

also two villains in this movie that you

feel like you're gonna have a big role

in it and then all at once are forgotten

immediately with really no importance at

all despite the whole movie the leading

up to them being a big deal they're just

kind of thrown away like it's the

fucking game of Thrones level where they

just forget about shit it's just bad in

every department and this story is rough

the only cool thing about the stories at

the end and the big conflict at the end

resolves in literally three seconds it's

all just resolved within a matter of

seconds this whole movie just kind of

concludes abruptly it's just bad I mean

the movies just not good man and it's a

shame because I really like the universe

and in black and I really think they

could do a lot of cool shit with it but

they just are not the first men in black

is still far and away the best one

they've made and I don't know if they'll

ever even get close to that I think one

thing that they're missing in every men

in black movie is that idea that the men

in black is just it's just another day

like in men in black one K goes

throughout the entire world ending

scenario stoic just treating it like

another day on the job another

nine-to-five just can't wait to get it

over with

whereas Will Smith is freaking out the

whole time and it's nice you know this

nice disconnect between the veteran the

seasoned veteran you know raw no rubber

K and Will Smith who's new on the job

freaking out like hey the world's about

to end he's got a sense the urgency K

just treats it you know monotonous ly

and that's a great thing and I think

that's what all the movies have been

missing since then here it's another one

of the things where everyone's this hall

high-energy and it's really bad comedy I

can't stress that enough it's really

shit in that department like offensively

bad and the actions you know just

plugging into the moist meter I'm giving

men in black international 25% I like

Tessa Thompson and I like Chris

Hemsworth but they're writing in this

movie is really bad so you can't

appreciate them on the screen together

very well

because other shit that they have to say

and what they have to present on screen

it's just not good enough

about this movie is really good it's not

worth seeing even for the most die-hard

men and black fan or a fan of action

movies or a fan of comedy there's just I

don't think there's a single group of

people this movie appeals to and will

please and that's about it anyway here's

agent J with some big intergalactic news

Jays for Jackson in this case not Will

Smith's character from the Murray first

movie we don't have Will Smith on the

moist meter we just have a little budget

asked Jackson here hey guys

Jackson here to tell you about the best

and most affordable way to host and even

build your own website it's good hosting

her and it's the premiere way to make

sure your website is the best it could

ever be you may have seen other hosting

sites that offer similar things but

we're hosting a difference is that it's

far more user friendly while other

methods are chaotic overwhelming and can

take time to learn hosting and make

setting up your own website super easy

you can have a website up and running

within five minutes of hosting her and

it even has the seamless WordPress

integration meaning you can just click a

single button and you're set up with a

great website I personally recently used

hosting as I've set up a website for a

side project Charlie is helping me with

and the process really surprised me this

is by far the easiest way to set up your

online presence and you may be thinking

well most I've proposed something maybe

it doesn't offer much customization or

super expensive but no there's still a

lot of depth to be found if you're

looking for it and it's also the most

cost effective hosting to be found

online trust me you're not going to want

to use a neuralyzer from men and black

to forget about the great experiences

you can have from hosting her if you

want guaranteed 99.9% uptime superior

speed performance and a 30-day

money-back guarantee on top of the

already stellar hosting and website

builder you can head on over to hosting

a dot-com slash penguin zero or use code

additional 15% off a hosting plan

thanks hosting her for helping me make a

fantastic website that I can be proud of

Moist Meter | Ma

initiating moisture Yama's not a good

horror movie I don't even know if it's

supposed to be a horror movie it's more

of like a character focused drama movie

which it also fails at executing well

and the only good part about this movie

is Octavia Spencer I think she does a

really good job with her character even

though her character is not even that

good it just seems like she gave a lot

of effort for the character and it shows

there's some good scenes from her but

the movies some straight stinky asshole

I thought this would be a so bad it's

good kind of horror movie I wasn't

expecting much but it's just the so bad

it's boring horror movie or whatever

kind of movie it wants to be I still

don't really know it's like high school

drama meets a little bit of attempt at

horror at the end maybe kind of like

that was kind of a little bit of an idea

they had it just doesn't work in any

level the writing is horrible the the

kids dialogue like the high school kids

dialogue is is nuts how bad it is it's

impressive how bad it is if I'm being

honest with you it's like an old man

went on Twitter and just searched lit in

the search bar and then just took all of

the the slang and all the lines you

could find under that and Twitter and

put it as the dialogue for the

characters here it just doesn't work it

feels wrong I know I'm getting kind of

old now but there's no way people talk

like this or make these kind of

decisions it's nonsensical at points for

example they're partying at Maz that's

not a spoiler you see it in the trailer

that's the entire point of the movie I'm

not spoiling shit don't you get on me

put that limp dick back in your pants

not spoiling it and now spoiler warning

this will be a spoiler to demonstrate

just how dumb the characters are

probably the dumbest I've seen in a

horror movie or whatever in a fucking

general movie in a long time this is a

spoiler but if you're going to MA for a

plot or anything at all you're

definitely going for the wrong reasons

and should probably save your money I'm

doing you a favor

mah pulls a gun on one of the kids that

goes to their house the first time

they're going to her house she pulls a

gun on him and tells him to get naked he

does and then she laughs and she says

it's just a joke but the guns real and

the kids are like oh she's just kidding

but she really didn't pull a gun on him

ha ha ha good one MA and then they go

back to partying and then they keep

going the Maz house to party and then at

some point they're like

so fucking crazy we should never go to

Maz house again two scenes later they're

back at Moss house and she's being crazy

as fuck again now we should stop going

no no let's go party at Maz and then go

party with no explanation as to why

they're all of a sudden okay with her

stealing and being crazy and pulling

guns and shit it makes no sense these

characters deserve that bad should

happen to them because they're so

fucking dumb it's it's it's laughable

it's honestly just laughable and it has

this element of trying to make you feel

bad for the ma the main character and

they kind of do that in a decent way and

it's only because Octavia Spencer

portrays emotion very well at the

writing for why her character is the way

she is is not good

there's nothing well written in this

entire movie the only thing that works

is by accident that they cast Octavia

Spencer who is good with this material

and makes it work sometimes it's just a

shit movie all around though in every

area it's not scary

it doesn't even attempt to be scary it's

not disturbing it doesn't attempt to be

disturbing really at least I can't tell

Tiana couldn't tell I don't think half

the theater could tell cuz a lot of the

times they were just laughing and when I

say the audience is laughing half the

time I don't mean at the comedy in the

movie there is comedy in the movie and

it's not bad sometimes the comedy is

pretty damn good but I mean during the

parts where it's supposed to be you know

a bit disturbing or a bit spooky and

scary and maybe even a little unnerving

that's when people were laughing the

hardest because it's the most cliched

generic attempts possible that you

almost have to feel like it was made

ironically by the directors but it's not

because the rest of the movie makes it

clear that there's really no

self-awareness with just how bad of a

horror movie this is this is it just

doesn't work anywhere as a teen drama it

doesn't work because it's supposed to be

like oh a new kid new kid's gonna get

picked on itself no new kids aren't in

the most popular kid in school and now

she's drinking and partying okay the

drama is she likes a boy but you know

what happens the boy also likes her

immediately so there's never any drama

there the only character that has any

depth there any fleshed out anything is

Octavia Spencer's character and that's

it and it's still poorly done it's just

a shitty movie man and it's so goddamn

boring it's so fucking boring like the

whole first

is just boring absolutely a drag a chore

to sit through I would have rather been

taking the garbage out just endlessly

pulling the garbage to the end of the

driveway and then back up to the house

back and forth back and forth like I'm

sawing a fucking log with my garbage can

that would have been more enjoyable than

the first hour it's just not a good

movie plugging this shit into the moist

meter I'm giving ma a 20% and the only

reason is because I really was pretty

pretty blown away by what Octavia was

able to do with such a shitty script I

really hats on if you're watching this

at a via you fucking killed it to the

actors and actresses that were in this

movie I'm sorry you got such a fucking

bad script as a concept this movie is

great it just that's executed really

poorly that's it so yeah

Moist Meter | Godzilla: King of the Monsters

initiating moisture Godzilla king of

monsters is more like Godzilla king of

raves there's more flashing lights in

this movie than any club or any fucking

music festival I've ever been to it's

fucking nuts every scene has like a

thousand different jump cuts as well as

just incredibly blinding flashing lights

I got a quick fart that was the sound of

my disappointment with this movie now

that's my biggest complaint is sometimes

it is actually painful to watch what's

happening on the streets to the screen

anytime King Ghidorah has an action

scene you're better off just closing

your fucking eyes it would be less

disorienting to stick my face in an

active police siren than suffer through

some of the scenes here the Lightning is

actually blinding I don't know maybe it

was the movie theater I went to

something was wrong with the screen is

just making it intense and it wasn't

just me Tiana was recoiling in her chair

she was like fucking audibly groaning

anytime that happened and she was

turning her head away the people next to

me were covering their eyes during some

of the scenes cuz it was that bad it is

actually painful to watch some of the

scenes in this movie and I've never

experienced that before the scenes

aren't bad visually the movies pretty

fucking good there's a lot of really

good visuals and when the fight scenes

didn't have King Ghidorah or King

Ghidorah wasn't using lightning and pee

I spoiler alert anytime King adores

their lightning is banging all over the

place like fucking Thor's coming in but

when that wasn't happening it looked

beautiful

the monster design I thought was superb

there's these beautiful destroyed city's

landscapes this ancient city they find

all of it looked lovely

I enjoyed the visuals when there wasn't

a lot going on when stuff would go on it

was just an incredible amount of cuts

that were enough to disorient ooh you

already coupled with flashing lights

that I cannot believe didn't make you

sign a waiver before seeing this movie

that you're about to maybe have an

epileptic episode it's nuts I've never

seen flashing to this degree anywhere

even in fucking clubs it's crazy and

that's my biggest complaint as well as

that I have another huge complaint every

character that's not a monster is bad

the writing for all the characters is

bad the dialogue is insufferable at

times

cheesy fun and other times but there is

no good characters there's no good

moments with any human characters

there's a lot of plot holes and a lot of

things I just don't make any sense you

just have to say you know what fuck it

it's there because it's you know it's

got to be it's just not a very good

movie when there is a monster fight and

you can deduce what's happening without

vomiting it's a pleasure a joy to watch

I absolutely love it sometimes and then

hate it the majority of the other times

because it does get actually hard to

look at the story really isn't something

that should be a huge complaint because

it's not the focal point of Godzilla at

least it shouldn't be

but here the story is the main juice the

main meat of the movie and it's so bad

that it is a big complaint because

honestly just give me something to set

up a bunch of monsters fighting and then

show me the monsters fighting that's all

you needed to do but they bog it down

with these dumb plot lines and narrative

choices and the characters choices don't

make any sense and none of the

characters just work it's just they just

shouldn't have bothered with the story

honestly it should have just been like a

apex of legends there's no story here's

just what you want the just good

gameplay in this case good monster

fighting that doesn't make you vomit or

shit your pants because it's so

disorienting plugging this shit into the

moist meter I'm giving Godzilla king of

the monsters at 30% nothing and it

really works except for the visuals

sometimes and there is a couple of the

cheesy moments that I couldn't help but

enjoy and because that's kind of what's

Godzilla was about cheesy moments fun

kaiju action and it does have that

occasionally but it's very sparsely

sprinkled into this movie it's kind of

just a shitty narrative shitty

characters wrapped around something that

makes you close your eyes half the time

because it hurts and that's why it's

just not a good movie that's it so yeah

Moist Meter | Brightburn

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're looking at bright burn

that's the evil Superman movie I fucking

love that concept an evil Superman movie

that's r-rated and ultra violent and

gory and this movie really delivers on

that front this movie does not pull any

punches it's about child Superman

becoming evil and just murdering anyone

at all just becoming this cartoonishly

evil character using his incredible

godlike powers to just annihilate human

beings and when I say in 9:00 late I

mean that in the most literal definition

of that word this kid does not hold back

there's a fucking scene where he causes

a man to explode as if he just swallowed

10 drums of gasoline and then stuck a

match up his asshole

it's just this huge bloody gory

explosion skin guts intestines flying

all over the place and there's just so

many of these like unnerving gory

moments gore I think is sometimes just

overused as a crutch for a horror movie

where it's just supposed to be like the

shock you know there's always like the I

scene and this is guilty of that trope

as well but in this movie there actually

is some unique plays with gore and

showing you really gross things and I

didn't expect that because the lead is a

kid it's child Superman but evil child

Superman his costume makes him look like

Quailman from Doug it's it's a goofy

costume but it works pretty well my

biggest complaint about the movie is

that the horror aspects of it don't

really work it's jump scares are

predictable not effective and it doesn't

build tension very well the movies at

its best when it's just showing this kid

toying with his victims and then killing

them there's the story isn't that great

either there's not a whole lot of depth

to any of the characters except for the

parents the parents do a great job I

think they were strong characters but

the kid has really no development or

anything at all he's just a very

two-dimensional character one second

he's a normal kid who you know just

standard human being in the next second

he's an evil super-powered guy because

he had a dream where he was super

powerful and now he wants to take over

the world and there's really no

development there's no conflict there's

never any up there's never a battle will

be within himself like hey I used to be

a kid that loved the

parents now I'm evil maybe you know

maybe I should think about this there's

never any of that until the end of the

movie has a moment of self-reflection

but it's kind of shitty and ham-fisted

because throughout the entire movie they

showed none of that he didn't do

anything that even resembled doing

something good it was all just the most

evil path he could have taken and so I

think it was a little silly to try and

all of a sudden at the end reel it back

and make it seem like hey he's still

just a kid trying to figure himself out

know you've established he is just

straight evil in all possible ways you

made that really fucking clear when he

started murdering people who gave him a

Jolly Rancher flavor he didn't care for

the kid just kills anyone and everyone

for no reason at all there's like a

fucking phase montage of him just

causing devastation across the world for

no reason

collapsing entire shopping centers

because they were sold out of yugioh

packs he just kills everyone and anyone

there was never a moment throughout this

movie where he struggled with what's

good and what's evil he committed to

just being evil so I thought it was

silly that at the end they try and make

it like oh maybe he's good because it

just didn't work at all and that's not a

huge complaint because I don't think

this movie really relies so much on its

story or its narrative it relies on its

concept and its execution and showing

you just how devastating it could be if

Superman was a bad guy and I think it's

a really fun thing they explored and I'm

excited to see more from bright burning

universe if there is more it'd be really

nice so let's plug this shit into the

moist meter I'm giving bright burn a 70%

I wish the narrative was better I wish

it told a better story however I think

it did just enough it gave you the

premise and it showed you a lot of cool

shit about him becoming the ultimate

evil and it was really a refreshing spin

on superheroes it was a really

disturbing look at it and I really

appreciated the risk they took and I

enjoyed it for the most part I really

think they missed the mark with their

horror elements it was just really

generic in that regard but everything

else it did well a lot of things we'll

definitely catch people off-guard in

terms of its gore and how the kid does

his shit it's just a very interesting

movie that was executed well I have a

lot of respect for this it was a good

movie that's it so yeah

Moist Meter | Aladdin

initiating moisture when the Aladdin

trailer dropped the entire Internet

myself included took a fat shit in there

nostalgia pants they were disgusted with

what they've done to the movie and they

were all saying how awful it was gonna

be I admit I was one of those people I

just saw a lot and it wasn't nearly as

bad as the trailers made it out to be

nor was it as bad as I expected it to be

it was a good movie

albeit a movie that did not get to need

did not need to get made nor did it add

anything to the Aladdin legacy or

anything like that the movie on its own

would be a pretty damn good movie if

Aladdin didn't exist already because it

is not as good as the cartoon in any way

in any department now the big thing

everyone hated about Aladdin was Will

Smith as the genie he looked like shit

he did not look like the genie he looked

like really bad CGI from a weird moment

and Power Rangers it just didn't work he

did not work as a blue genie and however

in the movie it does he does a decent

job when the blue Genie still doesn't

look good it still looks like ass it

looks like a fucking cardboard cutout

that's animatronic it just it looks bad

it looks like a really low budget CGI

blue genie for the Will Smith I didn't

care for that but when he wasn't the

blue genie when he was just Will Smith

as the genie being himself he was a good

character in fact he's probably the best

character in the entire movie and that's

not to say that when he's a blue genie

it's shit because those songs those

moments when he is the genie the bluest

cosmic powerful genie there is those

songs in those moments of the best part

of the movie this movie is lacking

enthusiasm it's lacking energy that the

original had because you can't translate

a lot of what made the original so

special and powerful into something

live-action it just doesn't work take

for example Jafar who was the weakest

part of this movie in the Moot in the

original Aladdin he is outstanding and

everything about him is cool scary

intimidating he's a great character in

this movie he's a joke he's like a

fucking cringy edge Lord a bad guy it's

awful he's not a good character and I

don't think it's the actor's fault or

anything it's just you can't translate

that kind of care

one-to-one in this movie for example

he's carrying a fucking snake stop the

entire stunt the entire movie that's

goofy that's not scary that's not

imposing that's not cool it's goofy

that's like something a four-year-old

would think would be awesome for a

Halloween costume it doesn't work and

the cartoon it does the movie a lot

doesn't you can't have that kind of

energy for the musicals like for example

the Prince of Ababwa you can't have that

kind of incredible musical performance

like in the original in this live-action

for example when they say you know

strong as ten regular men it's just it's

just Will Smith saying that line however

in the original cartoon you got like

fucking ten men flexing and shit and

it's really cool to look at and it's a

really quick moment and it's really nice

everything in the original is just done

much better than this live-action it was

never going to live up to that

now Will Smith doesn't even come close

to Robin Williams he never had a chance

there was never any never any

possibility where that came to fold

came to unfold however he does a good

job and like I said he's my favorite

character and probably just all around

the best character in the movie when

it's not Will Smith in the scene the

scene is boring the scene has really

weak dialog with almost no energy it's

delivered by like a high school thespian

group it just doesn't go over well it's

not because the actors aren't talented

whoever plays Jasmine Naomi Scott she

does a great job it's just the writing

and the characters you can't take from

Aladdin in the cartoon - Aladdin with

real people it just doesn't work it

doesn't feel right and I feel like the

director just didn't understand how to

keep that enthusiasm and energy and it's

a shame it's not a bad move it by any

means it's good but it's a movie that's

only going to get compared to the

original and that really brings it down

I don't think anyone's gonna walk away

blown away some people probably be

satisfied like yeah it wasn't a waste of

my time I'm one of those people it was

alright but it just it didn't need to be

made it didn't do anything it was

useless and it just was weaker than the

original as it was always going to be so

I don't see the point in making this

movie or why it exists but fucking is

out there now putting this shit on the

moist meter I'm giving Aladdin

live-action a 65 percent it's cute

wholesome visuals are good I forgot to

mention that the visuals and the

costuming I thought were really good

if albeit some of it better than other

points there's some weak CGI moments

like the genie as well as some

background shit

but overall it's it's pretty beautiful

honestly as you would expect from

something as big-budget is this but

again useless didn't need to exist not a

bad movie not nearly as good as the

original big kudos to Will Smith though

for actually doing a great performance

quite the fucking plot twist I don't

think anyone's gonna expect him to

actually be good in the role but he

doesn't really good job no Robin

Williams but not too bad and so yeah

Moist Meter | John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum

initiating moisture John wick Chapter

three is an absolute fucking masterpiece

of action it's probably it in fact it is

my favorite action movie of all time now

which is no easy title to have taken

with the raid and Dredd but it beats

both of those movies and by the way some

of the raid actors are actually in this

movie just letting you know that either

directors are aware of how much action

fans love the raid and they took those

actors and put them in a movie that's

even better than the raid it's

incredible also if you haven't seen the

raid highly recommend it the movie in

the action department is some of the

most fun I've ever had in a movie

theater the entire crowd was getting

involved in laughing with some of the

action and I say laughing with because

this movie is very self-aware at some of

the goofiness of its action it fully

embraces that to give you the most

enjoyable deaths and the most creative

action sequences of all time on the big

screen and the setting is constantly

changing it's not just gunfights in a

back alley or a warehouse its fights in

a barn John wick gets three kills using

a horse to kick people's skulls off

everything in this universe is a weapon

for John wick I'm surprised and start

using flashlights for weapons like I do

in fact if you're watching this Keanu or

director of the John wick series please

let me come aboard and I'll give you

some flesh light action sequences for

mr. wick to use in the next movie

it's just so good and it even reminds me

of Jackie Chan a little bit how Jackie

would blend fighting and comedy into one

and make a really unique comedic moment

John what does the same thing where it

uses its action and uses comedy at the

same time at points and delivers some

really fucking gut-busting moments it's

a lot of fun and you're not laughing at

those moments you're laughing with them

it's very clear that they're using that

fight for a joke and it works a hundred

percent of the time the comedy even when

it's not the physical stuff the comedy

in the movie is well-executed some jokes

don't really land and they're pretty

just flat but for the most part of the

comedy works because the characters are

so nice and just every time they try and

tell a joke with fighting and stuff I

think it worked

every time you guys because a lot of

movies don't do that anymore you'll have

just really serious dark and gritty shit

and John wick has some real gory fun

shit but it's not afraid to also have

some really goofy Looney Toons fucking

shit happen when a fight breaks out as

well it's a lot of fun the fighting is

genuinely second to none the action is

unmatched it has no equal in the medium

this story is also it's good it's

serviceable there's nothing riveting

about the story but John wick takes

place in a really interesting universe

so the story doesn't have to be great as

long as it can just take you on a little

fucking amusement park ride through its

universe which it does it has you going

all over the world meeting some really

cool characters but overall the story's

not that great the story's a bit goofy

but the story's just there to give John

wick more targets to blast the ass of so

in my book that's fine I also have a

huge pet peeve that this movie has

triggered me on I hate in movies where

the bad guy has a gun and the charges at

the protagonist up in melee range like

fucking trying to jam the gun in their

urethra just right up in their face

waving the gun without shooting so then

the protagonist has a chance to you know

come through the gun out of their hand

that happens a few times in this movie

but for the most part they stay away

from that trope but man when that

happens nothing makes my dick softer I

can't stand that shit charging the main

guy with a shotgun that you had locked

on him in the background for three or

four seconds just to go poke them in the

ass cheeks with it and then get it out

maneuvered I can't stand that that's

just a big pet peeve of mine and it does

happen this movie falls victim to it

there but that's the only thing I can

criticize about its action so let's go

ahead and plug this shit into the moist

meter John wick chapter three is getting

a 95% I highly recommend everyone go see

this movie if you haven't watched the

other two movies you don't really need

to I guess to see this one though you

would be doing yourself a big favor to

watch the previous two because they are

also very very very good and this movie

plays a lot into some references to the

previous movies as well as continuing

the storyline but again like the story's

not the biggest part of this movie it's

mainly about just seeing some fucking

nut busting action and it delivers a

hundred percent

incredible movie fucking loved it

fantastic see ya

Moist Meter | Mortal Kombat 11

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're looking at the new

Mortal Kombat Mortal Kombat 11 I'll go

ahead and be upfront I'm not a huge

fighting game guy the only fighting

games ever got into or Smash Bros

ultimate Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3

and Mortal Kombat 9 when Mortal Kombat 9

I put more hours into than any other

fighting game I've ever played

so I'd consider myself very familiar

with the series I didn't care much for

Mortal Kombat 10 however I'm happy to

say Mortal Kombat Elevens a little bit

closer to 9 than it is 10 though it is

still slower than both those games

mechanically and I don't think that's

necessarily a bad thing because it's due

to this slow pace that it opens itself

up to a lot more innovation I really

enjoy the crushing blow mechanic I

really like what they've done with the

fatal blow mechanic instead of just

having an X ray tied to meter I think

all of it works a lot better far more

intuitive and leads to a lot more fun

matches now I'm gonna go ahead and start

with a story no one really plays

fighting games for the story but Mortal

Kombat's always had an interesting one

in my perspective this one's a big step

back the story is a convoluted mess in

my opinion none of the decisions by any

of the characters really make any sense

and sometimes the story just feels like

a Power Rangers episode by that I mean

they'll have the bad guy the good guy

they'll square off be like Cain oh I'm

about to rip your spine out of your

urethra and then fuck your asshole with

it and then you beat Kano in the fight

and then you just walk away like I hope

you've learned your lesson now Kano

don't let me catch you being evil again

and then he comes back being evil and

then you do the same fucking thing again

and walk away same thing goes for the

villains as a villain you know I'm about

to fuck your asshole and then pull your

spine out of my asshole Johnny Cage then

you beat Johnny Cage I hope you've

learned your lesson now Johnny Cage I'm

evil and then they walk away they don't

finish the job for no reason half the

time like the story could have ended in

chapter 3 you not only become Lau and

Liu Kang the evil versions of them you

just let them walk you just get it you

just get the fuck out of there for no

reason it makes no sense it's just bad

plot armor and also the writing is

really bad all the attempts at humor do

not land at all it's not like self-aware

attempts at humor it's just bad writing

honestly it is very pretty to look at I

think there's some good cutscenes in

here with some really cool choreography

there is some deaths like you know

halfway through the game the tone shifts

from being I'm gonna let you go with a

warning you know that your seventh

warning in a row it goes from that to

putting a bullet right through the skull

okay no so it does change its tone which

is good I think it's much better in the

later half of the story but and I'm

critiquing this story really hard when

no one gives a fuck about it but this

story just got under my skin because it

was a big disappointment I love Mortal

Kombat 9 story and shit like that and it

just it was a big step back there moving

on to the part people actually care

about is the gameplay the combos have

never been better I also like the roster

a lot I really like how a lot of the

combos high-end each other and the way

you're able to use the offensive to bar

meter and defensive to bar meters

opposed to just one meter for everything

I like the way they've divided it up I

think it's a very clever use of the

meter and it makes it a lot more

strategic that's a word I use a lot in

this game because it's far more

strategic game than previous Mortal

Kombat's in my opinion the slower pacing

makes it have to be more about tactics

as opposed to you know out comboing

somebody it's all about timing you know

when are you gonna use your break away

from getting out I got out of a combo

starter when are you gonna use a

flawless block and then punish it

there's a whole lot of depth to the game

a ton of fucking depth and the tutorial

in this game is insane the tutorial

covers frame data for God's sakes I've

never seen a tutorial as in-depth as

this game has to offer it's totally

optional it doesn't force you to go

there it doesn't hold your hand and take

you for the lollipop or anything like

that it just gives you the option of

learning everything you can about Mortal

Kombat how the how the gameplay is done

advanced combo combo starters even

individual character training there's a

whole lot of shit in the tutorial and it

is incredibly well done the online is

also smooth for the most part I see a

lot of praise with the netcode however I

have experienced laggy matches not

overly often it's not enough to make me

you know flip a fucking table and pee my

pants but it's enough to be a little bit

frustrating and I imagine that's just

because it's launch day the biggest

complaint that I have the story I

complain about a lot but that's really

not a big part of Mortal Kombat that's

not a huge deal to me what is a big deal

to me is the overly greedy and

borderline criminal microtransaction

system this game has

the monetization in this game makes EA

look like Saints in comparison

so there's towers in the game the tie to

the challenge towers and you actually

can't complete some of those challenge

towers without grinding for loot box

item consumable shit to beat some of the

challenges they're downright unfair anti

fun challenges to begin with but not

only that they are actually impossible

to beat unless you have perfect rng and

some loot boxes and get some of the

consumable shit that you have to grind

hundreds of hours for someone did the

math if you wanted to buy all of the

skins in the game but you know to skip

the grinding it would cost you six

thousand four hundred and forty dollars

to buy all of the unlockable skins

without the grinding that is absolutely

absurd because the grinding is awful

absolutely awful

this monetization and in this game

nearly ruins the entire game for me this

takes a big fat fucking shit in the

cereal bowl for me this is the most

greedy microtransaction system I've ever

seen blowing star wars battlefront 2 out

of the water and anything else I can

even think of it's so goddamn disgusting

it makes me want to puke it should be

illegal the more the monetization method

that Mortal Kombat 11 uses absolutely

criminal that's the biggest complaint

and it's a big fucking complaint and I

wish reviewers would take this into

consideration when reviewing a game a

system like this being in place because

it actually halts your progress in the

chat that challenge tower it points and

if you do care about Cosmetics you're

gonna have to grind for thousands of

hours to get all of the skins actual

thousands of hours or spend thousands of

dollars to buy the skins the challenge

Tower is just genuinely unfair if you're

trying to do it without using you know

too many rare consumables and you can't

do half of them unless you have those

extremely rare god consumables they have

to grind hundred of out hundreds of

hours for and just pray that you get

good RNG from your loot box for the

perfect consumable to use against those

stage it is so anti fun I can't

recommend ever going into that for any

reason whatsoever it is just so brutally

chattin it's not challenging brutally

unfair to force your hand into grinding

to extend the game's lifespan and kind

of tilt you more towards buying

microtransactions that kind of help

along even though microtransactions

still

orangy in this game she still came and

paid for what you want

yeah and that's mainly just for skins

and shit anyway you can't you can't buy

loot boxes but it still makes you want

to do that instead of grinding for the

skins and shit the right way because it

is so unbelievably unforgivingly and

unapologetically unfun it's just so

fucking not fun and so long it's an

insult it's you lose no matter what you

lose just by buying the game at that

point it's so unbelievably silly and

upsetting to see it really is that's my

only complaint because everything else

about the game aside from the story

which isn't a big component I just

really wanted to vent about it because

it made me upset I'm playing the game on

the PC and on the one on one like in

ranked the connection was fine for the

most part but when I tried to do king of

the hill it was constantly laggy like

beyond words laggy it makes Nintendo

Online look like a useful and well worth

it service it was incredibly distressed

disgracefully laggy there was crashes

the game would hang up and I'd have to

force quit it I don't know if that's

universal to all platforms but on PC I

experienced that every time I tried king

of the hill but and ranked and just one

on one it was fine the roster in this

game I think it's 22 deep if I'm

remembering correctly all the characters

are pretty fun to play I don't like

playing Aaron black but he's like the

only one I genuinely don't have any fun

playing all the other ones are a lot of

fun with a lot of fun little combos I

don't know the bread and butters for all

of them right off the bat I haven't put

too much time into the combos yet but

the ones that I do know and have

mastered to a certain degree are really

satisfying everything else about the

game from a gameplay perspective online

the characters visually soundtrack all

of that is top-notch exactly what you'd

expect from another Mortal Kombat game

and a really good Mortal Kombat game at

that it's just it's reeling it into the

moist meter I'm giving Mortal Kombat 11

a 70% keep in mind this would be

somewhere in the 85 percent or higher

range because I really like the gameplay

so much and I just keep frothing at the

mouth to get back in training and learn

more combos with more characters but I

just can't help but be

unbelievably upset with what the game is

from a monetization and a greedy

standpoint you really see where another

realms priorities lied they wanted to

make this a game that they can milk the

fuck out of consumers try and corner

them into buying loot boxes to skip

grinding and it's a shame it's an

absolute shame and I think they deserve

a lot of backlash for it and they're

getting it it's just this such a good

game to such an incredibly good game but

you shouldn't have to pay six thousand

four hundred dollars to get all of what

the game already has in it it's just

silly it's unbelievably silly that's a

yeah

Moist Meter | Game of Thrones Season 3

initiating moisture continuing to blast

ask through gameofthrones we will now be

looking at the season three just

finished that shit and it was

significantly better than season two in

all possible areas all the plot lines

seemed a lot higher stakes

everything seems is becoming together

into like a big orgy of madness and it's

a really really fun story that I'm

completely invested in now even though I

was before but even more so now some

characters I cared about died in the

season very surprising with the Starks

at the red wedding fucking great

betrayal everything in the season really

felt impactful that will echo throughout

the rest of the series no doubt and I

really like that that's what season two

didn't have until the very end here

everything was massive and season two

even the very end like the battle was

super underwhelming even though it had

huge implications it was still like an

underwhelming battle here

there's nothing underwhelming at all

except Jaime Lannister's arc where he's

being delivered back to the Lannisters

and Kings fall that's the only thing I

didn't like I thought the entire Jaime

Lannister adventure the whole anime arc

with him was uninteresting not that it

was necessarily bad but I didn't care

for it I just wanted that to him so we

could get back to the other plot lines

not that I think Jaime is a bad

character I think he's a great character

just wasn't a very interesting story

there were some moments I did like you

know where a spirit gets broken and you

see a side of Jaime you've never seen

before in the show I appreciated that

but still just not a very interesting

plot that kept getting shoveled back in

I much preferred all of the other ones

the show going into it you always hear

you know it's titties with a little bit

of sword fighting and I think that's

doing it a disservice its titties and a

lot of passive aggressiveness and a lot

of really good story and the titties

start to really we now Taft er the first

season there I could count on one hand

the amount of titty scenes in this in

this season it's a very low amount so I

think that whole statement is just wrong

it's really not like porn which a lot of

people seem to think it is it

me included I thought it was just kind

of porn with a little bit of a story

attached to it as well like some not

Wizard of Oz type shit but it's actually

very fucking good and it's a shame that

it kind of has that reputation this you

know tells a story that I haven't seen

told before and it tells it really well

it's not afraid of tragedy and making

you know characters you care about

killed in gruesome ways surprising ways

it's just really it's a show that

doesn't pull any punches and I really

like that now it season two I had two

complaints about the visuals I don't

have any complaints about that in season

three the only complaint that carries

over is I still don't think this sword

fighting is that cool I think it's

pretty goddamn lame except for a couple

of scenes like there's a fight with

Jamie and his capture and it's not very

good it's just kind of boring I don't

like it I honestly I kind of wish there

just wasn't any sword fighting you so I

can tell a story at that point or more

passive-aggressiveness this sword

fighting just kind of makes me roll my

eyes sometimes but not all of its that

way there is some really good fight

scenes as well but for the most part

just not very interesting in that

department if you ask me that's not the

show strong suit

the show doesn't you know it's not John

wick of Thrones it's just it's a it's a

show that aims to tell a really riveting

old-school-style story and it tells it

like nothing else it's fucking great and

season 3 I think is better than both the

first and second season it got very dark

you know Theon Greyjoy getting tortured

and you feel bad for him but you kind of

feel guilty for feeling bad for him

because all the bad shit he did it

Winterfell

there's just a lot to like about the

season Daenerys is becoming this beacon

of justice and righteousness and the

dragons are cute and shit I really

really enjoyed season 3 I'll toss this

bitch over to Jackson now to give you

his thoughts I just want to let you know

that season 3 is one of the strongest

series of Thrones and I think that's

because it takes a whole lot of story

threads and it delivers an emotional set

of events that really just resonate

strongly it really makes you feel for

what your favorite characters are going

through and it's really just

improvements all around so pretty much

everything positive we've said about

Thrones is approved upon the

cinematography the visuals the writing

the acting all really

to come into the element the season at

this point as well it starts to become

easy to understand the politics and

intricacies of the world building while

still being surprised by the events that

happen which is a very important thing

because you don't want to be confused

but you want to feel like stuff that

happens has merit behind it happening so

now you don't get confused but you still

don't see what's coming

unless you've been spoiled at which

point you probably have already heard of

the infamous red wedding which is one of

the most emotionally charged moments in

the series and television in general and

it's something I was really looking

forward to being adapt the screen and it

just it blew it away all of my

expectations were delivered with the red

wedding you're gonna feel something this

season if you're even remotely invested

best episode of the season goes to

episode 9 rains of castamere obviously

best performances go to Richard Madden

as Robb Stark and Michelle Fairley as

Catelyn Stark for some really impactful

and just emotional scenes that I wish

didn't happen but they did the more

sweeter sensus regards this season and

has opted to sit at a 90 percent

yes that's 90 percent it's a good season

one of the best we're currently we

Moist Meter | Game of Thrones Season 1

initiating moisture I watched the first

season a game of thrones years ago and I

didn't really care for it so I never

went back to it and I also hate that

idea of oh you have to just watch it you

know 80 episodes before it really gets

good just you know get through the first

80 episodes and you'll like it well fuck

you at that point you're just convincing

yourself you like it because you put so

much time into it it's not worth

watching 80 episodes or something you

don't like just to start to get fucking

Stockholm Syndrome into liking it so

after watching season 1 I never touched

it again all those years ago until now

Jackson recently you know made a very

convincing argument with season 8

rolling around to catch up and watch all

of it so Jackson twisted my arm and my

cock to watch all of Game of Thrones and

catch up so that's what we've been doing

we've been binging Game of Thrones and

we just finished season 1 and we're

gonna moist meter every individual

season and I'm happy to say I'm

pleasantly surprised I don't remember

what I didn't like about Game of Thrones

all those years ago but I'm happy I've

gone back to it so Jackson and I are

gonna do this together I'm gonna give my

thoughts and he's gonna give his because

he's a fucking expert in Game of Thrones

this man studies Game of Thrones like

it's a fucking college course in the

history of Game of Thrones he knows

everything about it inside and out

he could probably tell you every little

piece of George RR Martin's Coleman if

you asked him this man has done his

homework so I wanted him to help me with

this to really give an accurate moist

meter score for season by season my

thoughts on season 1 are it is

extraordinary in set design costuming

and acting it is so goddamn impressive

what they've done here you know every

scene really feels like it fits in the

time period all the costume even the way

they speak all of it just sounds so

fucking appropriate for the time period

not that I you know lived back then or

have a fucking crystal ball that I could

look back in the past on and see how it

actually was but I feel like this is

probably how it actually fucking was I

feel like there's a time traveler on

staff here that's really making it super

accurate it's crazy it's absolutely

insane what they've done for a TV show

this is the kind of shit you can't even

capture in movies half the time and

they're doing it beautifully in this

show it's really really good second to

none I can't think of another show that

reaches the level that this does with

its set design and costuming Act

there's plenty of other shows with great

acting even though this one is really

good but those two things the set design

and costuming is beyond anything else on

TV now I want to get into a couple

complaints the thing I really didn't

like a lot about season 1 was the sword

fighting the actual action scenes I

thought were super lackluster for the

most part save for a couple of good

fights here and there but when there is

action it's pretty childish it looks

like you're watching two kids playing

with toy lightsabers you know they'll

throw one sword swing the block the

sword swing then they just both stand

there looking at the swords and then all

of a sudden one guy brings a sword down

on the other guy and it's over it's

really underwhelming it's really boring

and it looks really really bad because

you know someone throws a sword he

blocks it and then now the guy is just

standing there like a fucking statue

he's not moving his swordsman blocks it

now his fucking brain shuts off just

standing there like a mindless zombie

who then gets killed it's really not

well done I'm hoping they get better

throughout the next couple of seasons

but for season 1 it was really bad

watching the actual sword fighting stuff

happen and also I didn't like how and

I'm assuming it's cuz of budgeting

they'd have these big landmark battles

you know where they captured Jaime

Lannister and they don't show you

anything they just you know all of a

sudden here is Jaime Lannister and they

tell you what happened they don't show

you anything and I'm guessing it's

because of budgeting but that still

can't help but be disappointed another

complaint I have is the show overloads

you with characters they give you so

many names that they expect you to

remember just by saying it one time and

that wouldn't be too bad if the names

were a little easier to remember but

because they give the whole title you

know turbo virgin House of Clan weeb and

then they'll never mention that entire

title again they'll just mention him by

you know Turbo v or something it makes

it hard to keep track of the characters

so oftentimes you know the scene will

have them talking about a character that

you know you've seen before you've met

but you have no idea who they're talking

about because you don't know them by

name or they're not giving the whole

title like they did the first time

unless you're a little lost it's very

very hard to remember all of the

characters especially when they're only

very vaguely being talked about but they

become very important for the

conversation and the overall plot so it

gets frustrating to get lost like that

but the story is apps

fantastic I'm totally invested in it and

I can't wait to see where it goes

there's a lot of big moments in the show

and it doesn't pull any punches a lot of

characters die that you don't expect

will die it was really fucking gripping

I don't know why I didn't fall in love

with the story the first time around

really I might have maybe I was just

watching this my fucking eyes closed I

don't know because I don't remember the

complaints I had about it now but I

fucking love the story and the

storytelling

I love the world-building making it all

feel so full I also like that they don't

do a whole bunch of flashback shit they

don't do any flashback shit really if

they're gonna talk about a character's

past they tell this story and they tell

the story of the past really really well

it's like listening to your fucking

grandfather tell you a bedtime story

it's it's beautiful it feels nice to

listen to and you can picture the

scenario in your head you know Ned

talking about when they went into battle

with Robert when they were overthrowing

the Mad King it's they tell you this

story and you visualize it because they

tell it so well and the way they act

with their facial expressions makes you

feel the characters emotions during the

fight and what they thought during the

fight

it's fucking great and I really liked

that little detail because I think

flashbacking

would probably take away from it overall

another thing I'd really like to make

note of is the music the music in this

show is absolutely beautiful truly

magnificent stuff in that department

really enjoyed the score and that's

really like my whole thoughts on season

1 I I think overall it was an extremely

enjoyable season I don't know what issue

I had with it back those years ago and I

watched it was like four years ago now

maybe I was just in a bad mood like my

dick wasn't as big as I thought it was

or something I don't know

but it really is not bad I enjoyed it

quite a bit now I'm gonna go ahead and

let Jackson take it away here and give

you like the super nerdy thoughts on it

so go ahead Jackson it's your turn hey

guys it's Jackson here I don't know what

nerdy details he wants me to tell you so

I'm just gonna give my review of season

1 I guess Game of Thrones is one of the

largest and most popular series on

television for a good reason

the showrunners made a very strong

choice in season 1 to stick extremely

close to the source material that the

show is adapted from and this decision

pays back in spades as it tells a

harrowing

story of one man's effort to serve both

his family and his realm with honor this

season and series has some of the

strongest characters are pretty much any

television show and that along with the

set design and costuming that Charlie

mentioned create an incredibly gripping

series of hour-long episodes not only

are the characters entertaining as fuck

to watch they're all acted superbly and

have some really rich character

development in a season that is very

much setting the stage for seasons to

come it still feels like a lot directly

happens and there are many moments that

define the series as a whole

I've watched season 1 and read the book

several times over and I still find it

hard to tear my eyes away from the

screen when the show is on the

characters are just so damn gripping and

grounded and well-written the casting in

this is also very strong

every actor portrayed their character so

well but I find it very hard to imagine

them as anyone else now standout Sean

Bean as Lord Eddard Stark in Charles

dances Tywin Lannister the ruthless Lord

of House Lannister who absolutely

commands every scene he is in but

honestly there's just not a bad actor in

the season and everyone breathes so much

life into their characters Kit Harington

in particular kills his role as Jon Snow

bastard son of a dad stark and and god

damn it's just he's so good-looking

some people call Game of Thrones fantasy

and it definitely does become that in

later seasons but this first season is a

pretty genuine period P slash political

drama in my opinion as you watch the

warring houses fight battles between

each other more from the shadows the

dialogue is witty the pacing is

excellent and the twists and turns

devious definitely so in this season the

only downside I can think of for myself

is that there was some obvious

limitations placed on some fight /

battle scenes due to what I imagine

would have been budget constraints

considering this is the first season but

it would have been nice to see those

scenes especially with the same detail

and effort that went into creating the

later fights in future seasons now

Jackson's gonna give the moist meter

score which is a combination of his

thoughts and mind using some very

advanced mathematics and algorithm to

calculate in a very accurate moisture

score with our two combined thoughts on

it and we're gonna do this for every

season leading up to season 8 and

including season 8 so buckle the fuck up

because there's gonna be quite a few of

these I'm I'm binging this shit hard

we're gonna get there

by Episode two hopefully so yeah doing

all that scientific shit Charlie and I

were able to determine the moisture

rating of season one and it's sitting at

about an 85 percent this season is great

there's not a singular bad episode in

the bunch most of them would be rated

around 80 to 90 percent with episode

seven nine and ten easily earning a

ninety five percent as they're some of

the best content that's ever been

produced for television

all in all those season 1 gets an 85

percent like Charlie said we'll be

reviewing each season as we finish

binging it so we'll see you soon with

season 2

Moist Meter | Hellboy

this episode of moist mater was brought

to you by hump tequila

you've no doubt already read how bad

Hellboy is I'm here to tell you it's

pretty shitty but god damn it I can't

recommend it enough

it's unapologetically edgy gory and

goofy the movie genuinely sounds and

looks like it was written by a bunch of

14 year-olds jerking off and like the

basement of their parents house drinking

alcohol they're not supposed to have but

they stole it from their dad from under

the bed in his secret stash they just

started like writing what they thought

would be edgy and then they made it into

this movie and there was a certain charm

to this movie there's nothing good about

the writing the writing sucks some of

the fattest asshole I've seen in quite a

while the one-liners are the worst I

think I have ever heard in any

big-budget movie fuckin Power Rangers

had better one-liners and speaking of

Power Rangers the CGI in this movie gets

really shitty at points like the main

pig demon looks like straight fuckin ass

cheeks an actual Power Rangers villain

costume it seems like they got for him

but all that being said I really enjoyed

this goddamn movie I would recommend it

the movie is so stupidly edgy that it

takes on a life of its own it's like

almost self-aware but it's clearly not

self-aware type of edgy movie the humor

never works it's not even so bad it's

good in the humor department but the

edginess does and it is so goddamn gory

for no reason half the time that I loved

it there's people's skin getting ripped

off their face getting ripped in half

eyes getting eaten by Ravens fucking

nuts getting busted nuts getting slammed

together dicks getting ripped in half

dicks getting peeled like a banana peel

dicks getting degloved

there's a lot of fucking gore in this

movie for no reason half the time and

it's great it's super great I don't know

why it's there but it's entertaining

when it is if you ask me I would never

consider this a good movie I would

certainly not consider this a good movie

in any department especially editing

shit just kind of happens out of nowhere

for no reason all the time the

characters

suck they're not developed well you

don't like a single character in this

movie but goddamn it when the action

unfolds and you got arms and limbs

flying all over the place come and blood

tears all of it all over the screen it's

really enjoyable I don't know why people

are shitting on that aspect I thought

that was really good they're like oh

yeah the gore made it boring it bullshit

the gore made it boring you pussy Micro

dick the gore made it tolerable made it

really really comedic sometimes this

shit was entertaining when it was

happening in that in that area but it's

not good I'd say it's a so bad it's good

movie but it's really not bad in the

visuals Department at all yeah there's

definitely some bad CGI and some

questionable decisions throughout but it

has a really nice aesthetic to it and a

nice tone to its visuals that I think

complement it really well there's a some

slow-mo scenes that just the the slow-mo

just seems weird there's something wrong

with the slow-mo like the slow-mo

fucking broke during rendering but they

didn't fix it so there's definitely some

glaring issues but visually it's nice to

look at there's some demons that come

out that are really genuinely

cool-looking shit and most of the action

scenes are cool even if at times hard to

decipher what exactly is happening I

think the movie has a certain charm to

it that I think fans of Hellboy can

appreciate at least if you like the

original to Hellboy's which I do

you can still appreciate this one even

though it's totally different I think

it's very very different in all possible

ways to del toro's Hellboy vision but I

don't think that's a bad thing I really

don't I think it's really fucking

adorably odd what they've made here that

I appreciate it plugging this shit into

the moist meter I'm giving Hellboy a 30%

it's like I said it's not a good movie

but it is a movie I'd recommend I was

thoroughly thoroughly entertained except

anytime Hellboy tried a one-liner or

anyone tried to make a joke that's when

I'd roll my eyes and wanna you know get

the fuck out of the theater cuz it was

really really bad they'd if they're

gonna do a sequel like they hint at in

this movie they need to just fire the

team that came up with the comedy

because it was awful and also fire the

editors and fire the person who wrote

the story as well and then maybe

you'd have something going for you well

that's it see ya hey there folks jackson

chief investigator of water related

murders here have you ever wanted to

solve a murder

enjoyed the fun that comes with hunter

Moist Meter | Pet Sematary

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're looking at the new

horror movie Pet Sematary modern horror

movies are a lot like shit

they're shitty and Pet Sematary isn't

that much of an exception there's

nothing unique about Pet Sematary it

doesn't do anything new it doesn't do

anything particularly well either it's

just a pretty bland generic horror movie

it's based on Stephen King's book of the

same name most of the complaints I see

here from people saying all the changes

they made they weren't in favor of and I

didn't read the book so I don't give

much of a fuck about that but what I can

recognize about this movie is it's just

a goddamn generic horror movie but it

does certain things well enough that

it's better than most modern horror

movies I think in terms of building

suspense there's some scenes that are

executing it very well in the movie

there's a dumbwaiter scene that's drawn

out over the course of like a minute

thirty of just sound and slow movements

that I think did a great job of building

up to a very predictable jump scare but

overall there are scenes that do tension

building well in the movie but the scare

that it goes for is more just a

predictable jump scare that you know is

coming you prep yourself for and

sometimes still get startled by so I

guess that speaks to you know some

degree of talent they make you know a

jump scares coming and then still get

you with it

but I mean the movie is like I said a

generic horror movie the acting is good

enough the acting is nothing wild it's

not like hereditary level but it's good

enough it sells you down some good

performances from the main cast some of

the things I like about the movie is the

pacing I actually think the pacing in

the movie is pretty decent it fits its

overall dark tone so I can definitely

respect why it had the rather

questionable pacing that most people are

you know talking about I think it

actually fit the tone in the movie

pretty well so I don't have a problem

there and also like that the movies are

rated so it doesn't water itself down so

to show you some creepy gory shit to get

under your skin and really sell you on

the dark tone of the movie which place

of the strength of the movie there's not

a whole lot of strength to the movie to

begin with so they really needed that

and then I just need the fucking Vint

about this the there's trucks in this

movie the house is right next to a main

road and there's these big fucking

trucks that are constantly driving down

that road and that's such a big part of

the whole movie literally like everyone

in town is getting hit by those fucking

trucks you'd think they would come up

with like a law or something where those

trucks can't drive that road because the

fucking truckers are literally

slaughtering the entire goddamn town

every single scene has a new person

getting hit by a fucking truck on the

road it's incredible that's just you

know a little nitpick right there I

don't know if that's in the book but it

shouldn't be called Pet Sematary it

should be called shitty truckers on a

one-lane Road it's fucking dumb how many

people get hit by the trucks in the

movie spoiler alert I guess but anyway

it's just a really generic cliche horror

movie I don't have a whole lot to say

about it there's some things it does

well and it is an above average horror

movie it doesn't fall victim to like

really shitty jump scares or really bad

tension building and it is kind of a

creative concept in a certain way that I

just don't think was executed all that

well the ending I think is very silly it

has a very silly ending but overall not

a bad horror movie plugging this shit

into the moist meter I'm giving pet

sematary a 60% a tight that I definitely

think it could have been better and

probably the books better I don't know

but I'm not reading the book but anyway

that's the end that so yeah

Moist Meter | Shazam

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're looking at Shazam

DC's been known to make some real stinky

dogshit diapers for movies in their DC

Universe and recently they've been

turning it around and I'm happy to say

they keep up the momentum through Shazam

it's a good movie but DC's also known

for its awful CGI and Shazam keeps that

up and takes it to the next level by

having some of the shittiest CG I've

seen from them yet but that aside it's

still a good movie the thing is Shazam's

at it's worse than when it's giving you

action Shazam is not so much a superhero

movie as much as it is a family comedy

and a coming-of-age story with some

superhero elements to it it's kind of

hard to explain but this has almost

nothing that the modern superhero movies

have with like big climactic fights

villains that are fleshed out and then

like a big CGI payoff you know brawl

fest dicks flying everywhere it doesn't

have that it has a very weak villain

that I think is super shitty a very

2-dimensional uninteresting villain but

it has this great cast of characters I

think the entire crew even in the foster

home where most of it takes place I

think everyone in the foster home is

great I like the relationship between

the main character Billy and his

sidekick Freddy I really enjoy the

dynamic and the relationship between all

the characters it tells a pretty

compelling story not anything new or

original but told very well a story of a

kid who doesn't fit in learning to

accept the you know the people around

him as his family and it's really cute

and it's well told the comedy hits more

times and it misses despite there being

some very clear misses and overall I

think the tone of the movie has shifted

more for a younger audience in terms of

some of the jokes it makes and the

reference isn't shit but it's still very

enjoyable for anyone who likes you know

a good movie it's just very wholesome

and heartfelt now I got touched on

briefly the main villain sucks some

filthy asshole he's an extremely boring

uninteresting character whose only

motivation is I'm not pure of heart so

I'm gonna be real evil that's quite

literally his entire character is I am

not pure

so I'm going to steal power and be

powerful evil it's not it's not good

he's a shit character but he's that's

okay in this movie because this movie

isn't about hero vs. villain and saving

the day

it's about hero learning to become a

hero and accept it and you know figuring

out who he is and the villain is

important and pushing him in that

direction so I get that I get that he

wasn't in the main focal point of the

movie but I can't help but feel like

there could have been a better way a

better villain or something because it

was just so goddamn weak and the main

villain has seven demon sidekicks and

they look like shit

they look like Power Rangers villains

the honestly that entire aspect like the

actual fighting and shit looks like

straight out of a 1990 superhero movie

that you'd see on like Nickelodeon is

like a licensed property done by a B

studio it's shit it is really bad I'm

not gonna sugarcoat it I didn't like any

of the actual action and anything

involving the villains it's just really

really not well done and again I know

it's not the main focus of the movie

that's why it's not a massive complaint

because there's awesome there's not a

whole lot of it but it's there and I do

think it should be done well especially

for a big-budget movie I can't believe

that they would have the demons looking

as bad as he doing here they look like

they're fucking claymation and when they

are like fighting or doing anything it

is so goddamn stiff it's like I'm

watching someone puppet action figures

with a string it's terrible it's

terrible it really is but it is still a

good movie because that is not what it

is about so I can forgive that and

that's why it's not a huge complaint but

it is a complaint nonetheless what

Shazam does that no superhero movies are

doing right now is just be a

light-hearted fun experience and know

that that's what it is trying to be it

doesn't try and give you something

gritty and darker realistic and you know

anything like that it gives you just

something that's entertaining something

to tug on your heartstrings a little bit

something to make you laugh something to

make you feel and that's what it does

and it relishes and that's very

self-aware with some of the jokes it

makes it very self-aware with the tone

it wants to set with this overly cheesy

atmosphere that it sometimes gives

itself and I can really respect that and

I think it does it very well so let's

plug this shit into the moist meter I'm

giving

Shazaam a 70% I like I said the only

real complaints I have are in the action

Department you know I understand that

that's not what this movies about but

goddamn it it's in here at least do it

decently enough to be passable here it's

like a genuine fucking TV standard it's

not like a big budget movie standard

it's really shitty and I can't help but

point that out I feel like everyone else

glosses over that because they

understand that that's not the focus but

I mean it's there it should at least be

palatable it tastes like a fucking wet

fart in my mouth watching an action

scene it was also impossible to decipher

to some of the moves that were going on

every time someone got punched it's like

the camera got punched itself and

everything fucking exploded and like

everyone was made out of helium everyone

was flying all over the place all the

time like nothing had any weight it's

just really bad in that department

that's what really holds the movie back

but everything else I love everything

else about the movie I really do I think

they did a great job delivering a very

you know heartfelt heartwarming family

little you know feel session with Shazam

and it's cute it's a really cute movie

that's it yeah

Moist Meter | Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're looking at a real

grizzled elite gamer status hardcore

game sekito shadows died twice from

software's newest game let me go ahead

and say souls light games are my

favorite games out there it's among my

favorite genres I've played literally

every big-budget Souls like game

including low into the Fallen and the

surge which a lot of you fake pussy ass

gamers seem to have skipped over I was

out there putting nuts to butts on those

games and I still enjoyed those I fuckin

loved the genre and I'm happy to say

sekito shadows die twice is a beautiful

entry into it gave me some fat boners

and now it's time to share that hard

penis with you and what my thoughts on

the game were now I think most people

were expecting sekito to be Dark Souls

clone Dark Souls in a different coat of

paint a Trojan horse for Dark Souls just

in a different time period and it's not

this is a very mechanically different

game from the souls series and that's a

good thing they explored different ways

of combat and I think for the most part

it flows and works really well and I

don't think anyone's surprised to learn

that sekito is a good game from software

really fucking kills it in this genre

and they really did try and innovate in

this one and I think for the most part

they did something very unique it's not

an overly different game from the souls

games if you've played the series you're

gonna feel right at home in here it's

immediately recognizable as a Souls like

game but it plays very different for

instance in Souls like games typically

you rely on dodging as your primary

method of avoiding damage sometimes

you'll block sometimes you'll parry but

primarily you're gonna be dodging in

this game

dodging isn't that useful primarily

you're gonna be focusing on deflecting

and breaking your enemy's posture that's

a new thing they added is the posture

system the more you attack the more they

block the more you block the more you

deflect the more damage you're doing to

their posture and the more damage you're

taking to your posture if you break

their posture even if you haven't taken

down all their health you get to use a

finisher on them and it's fucking

satisfying and it makes it very

strategic each fight seems like a really

impressive showdown between two highly

skilled swordsman and trust me as an

admin Reddit user neckbeard

understand the ways of the blade and it

really feels like a real sword fight

they fucking nailed it here especially

when it comes to one-on-one with like a

mini boss a strong enemy or a boss

one-on-one in this game just feels so

fucking great now the difficulty is what

a lot of people are debating on is

sekito easier than Dark Souls and my

answer is I'm not sure I really can't

tell the game is certainly more

forgiving

sekito has idols basically this games

bonfires all over the place you can't

walk ten fuckin feet without running

into an idol you could stop take a piss

at one of the idols then walk downstairs

and find another Idol a great example of

this is an achene a castle at the top

level after you defeat a boss you unlock

an idol you go downstairs and you

immediately get another Idol so you have

an idol on one floor and on the floor

below it literally about ten feet apart

they give you so many idols also death

isn't as punishing as it is in Dark

Souls you lose some of your sin which is

your currency and then half of your XP

as well but really neither one were that

big of a deal in my playthrough losing

the sin didn't exactly feel as

devastating as getting like rejected the

problem or anything neither did losing

the XP because you can get it back

pretty easily plus when it comes to

losing XP you never drop a level so

let's say you start at two level two and

your skill points and you die 50 fucking

times you just get a sandblasted 50

times you never go back to level one you

still stay at that benchmark right there

so death I think is a little more

forgiving in this than the soul series

where you lose all your souls and you

get kind of fucked hard sometimes this

one you never really feel like you're

getting face fucked by death you can

kind of just keep charging at it if you

let's say you spend all your sin you can

kind of just keep charging at a hard

enemy or a hard horde and just fucking

meatball on your way through just

fucking keep dying

just keep wet noodling it and never have

to worry about it because it's not that

big of an issue the only thing is if you

do die you have an option of

resurrecting and the resurrection causes

dragon rot which will lower your unseen

aid which is another mechanic in the

game and also inflected inflict your

NPCs with what's called dragon rot which

makes some quest lines inaccessible so

that can definitely be a hindrance but

you can get rid of dragon rot and you

can choose when you get rid of dragon

rot based on when you use

the item to get rid of it I think all of

these mechanics work really well but

overall make it a more forgiving Souls

like game for some people that's a

positive for others it's a negative for

me I was neutral on it because it's

still just a fun fucking game now one

thing I really have to critique on the

game is the camera the camera betrayed

me more times than I can fucking count

especially indoors indoors in an

enclosed space sometimes it'll just take

the lock off of the enemy and it'll

throw itself into like a goddamn toilet

somewhere just get lost in the shitter

you can't see anything and you just get

absolutely clobbered and by no fault of

your own just some spotty camera shed

and I also don't really like sequitos

approach to difficulty in some

circumstances in some boss encounters

and mini boss encounters the way they

make it hard sometimes isn't because

it's a hard enemy it still throw

multiple enemies in addition to that

enemy at you so they'll just try and

overwhelm you with numbers and then it

becomes a huge challenge I think that's

a really lazy way of making a boss or

mini boss challenging I prefer if his

combo strings or moves were just better

designed and make it a more mechanically

challenging boss instead of holy shit

I'm just getting hazed in the football

team's locker room here by all of these

enemies I just don't like that approach

all that much also in the game you get a

robo arm a prosthetic arm which comes

with a lot of different attachments like

a fucking flamethrower things like that

I think all of the prosthetics were very

very situational to the point where

you'd almost never use them and you'd

always just forget the even Adam I don't

think the prosthetics ever really had a

strong purpose at least in my initial

playthrough new game+ I find myself

using it a bit more that's another thing

new game+ is extremely easy I expected

it to be harder not not a complaint just

saying but the prosthetics never really

solidified themselves as a valid thing

to use against any enemies of any kind

sometimes like with the finger whistle

prosthetic you can plan out a strategic

attack and I could see the use in that

but in terms of combat I don't think you

will ever use a prosthetic for more than

like breaking a shield or something with

the axe you're just very briefly

stunning the boss with the firecrackers

you can get one cheap shot in on him or

break up his combo also in addition to

that there's a couple skill

trees that are totally fucking worthless

as well the martial arts tree serves

genuinely no purpose at all it doesn't

really increase the duration of your

consumables by much maybe like two or

three seconds from what I've seen and

also it doesn't increase your sin gain

by that much and all of the offensive

moves in the martial arts tree you

should never ever get it's a huge waste

of your skill points I've seen no reason

to ever use anything from the martial

arts tree and the last complaint I have

about the game is the the hook shot I

don't exactly know how else to explain

it the thing that you latch on to rooms

and you swing towards them to put it for

all of you non sekito veterans out there

that lock-on is very all over the place

and inconsistent sometimes you're like

right underneath the thing that you want

to grapple on to and it will not pick it

up it just it seems like it works when

it wants to work and sometimes it just

fuckin falls asleep and won't work at

all I swear that shit just made me so

soft sometimes but anyway let me plug

this shit into the moist meter I'm

giving sekito shadows died twice an 85%

I think the game is spectacular I

fucking loved it start to finish also

the final boss I think is a huge huge

piece of shit the final boss is the

hardest boss in any souls like game I

have ever played and I beat the shit out

of every souls like game and I never

struggled as much as I did on the final

boss you have to fucking fight four

different phases with full health bars

and this the third phase and fourth

phase of the final boss I think are just

genuinely unfair to a certain degree I

had to cheese it to beat him and I'm

embarrassed to say that because I've

never had to resort to using any type of

cheese on any boss in any of the souls

like games but in this one I

unfortunately did I haven't gotten back

to him in new game+ yet I'm taking my

time and exploring again and this time I

feel like I can probably get him but

still that boss is fucking brutal now

I'm always asked to the tier list one

you know put the souls like series in

order from best to worst so I'll give

you my tearless for the souls like games

number one neo Neos my favorite souls

like second place Dark Souls 1 third

place blood-borne fourth place sekito

and then fifth place Dark Souls 3 sixth

place the surge seventh place Dark Souls

2 eighth place demons

and the ninth place lords of the fallen

that is my soul's like tier list and

that's about it so yeah

Moist Meter | Us

this episode of moist mater was brought

to you by hunter-killer

welcome to the moist meter I recommend

you stretch out your fingers and get

them prepared to write an essay in the

comment section all angrily and shit

because I already know it's coming

because I didn't think us was very good

at all I'm a huge fan of get out it is

in the top three of my favourite horror

movies of the last decade to say I was

going into this one excited would be an

understatement and to say I left

disappointed would also be an

understatement I'm gonna start with the

things I liked about the movie there's a

lot I liked about the movie no doubt the

best thing about this movie is the score

the composer for this movie is second to

none absolutely fucking superb honestly

probably the best score of any movie

I've seen in the last couple of years

save for into the spider verse that that

movie is hard to beat in that department

but this was up there this was

extraordinary

the sound design the way it built

tension using music and trust me as I

thought the only way it builds tension

in this movie because what you see on

the screen is constantly being

interrupted with attempts at humor that

sometimes lands sometimes don't and it

seems like none of the characters even

take the threat seriously despite good

acting it just feels like wrong

direction I'm getting sidetracked into

negative things but the score the music

builds up in these nice crescendos

during some supposed to be tense moments

there's also just overall a great

soundtrack to the movie from some

remixes on classics also there's some

classic horror spins that the composer

puts on it absolutely adored the music

in this movie another thing I really

liked was the acting the performances

from pretty much all the actors were

solid you got a real sense of dread most

of the time and the fact that each actor

plays a different version of their same

character and has to do it completely

differently is nothing shy of impressive

in the way they're able to pull it off

for the most part that's about the only

compliments I can give this movie and

also conceptually I have to say

conceptually I think on paper this movie

sounds fucking great but an execution

it's it's like a b-movie it's just not

good I can say that it kind of

transcends whole

it goes from like a home-invasion whore

in the beginning to like a little bit of

a slasher thing and then towards the end

still a slasher thing but less emphasis

on the slashing and more so just beating

you over the head with what the whole

movie was about a lot of praise I see

for this movie there's a lot of it it's

about ambiguity and about all of the

meanings you can derive from the movie I

don't get that sense at all no doubt

there's a lot of metaphors you can pick

apart in the movie and I do like that

aspect but the end of this movie

literally bends you over and fucks you

with what exactly the movie was about

and exactly what was taking place and

then it shoehorns in a twist that you

could see coming a mile away

and hoped wouldn't happen because it

completely throws off the narrative the

twist that this movie has it seems like

it was thrown at the last second just

because I thought it needed a twist but

it was too late

for it to make sense and it's hard to

explain without spoiling anything but

when you get the twist immediately

you're gonna think about the movie

backwards and be like well none of this

makes sense now now all of a sudden you

take this new idea and you watch this

movie back and the movie to me falls

apart because now all of the motivation

around all sides of this movie is thrown

out of whack and shouldn't have happened

in the first place there's so many plot

holes once you get this twist and I

think this movie could have really

benefited it and would have been a much

better movie if the last 30 minutes just

weren't in it because the last 30

minutes is literally spent driving home

exactly what happened in this movie

which it shouldn't have done ambiguity I

think - horror movies like this is very

important if you didn't have that big

reveal and that huge just vomit of

exposition you'd have all kinds of

fucking fan theories going up by the

minute and that's exactly how it should

have been because that's fun that makes

the movie seem bigger than it maybe even

intended to be and it definitely could

have been that but somewhere along the

way they decided to just cram in a

shitty twist a predictable shitty twist

and a really long drawn-out really

sub-optimal explanation for everything

that the movie didn't need and I can't

criticize that enough because it really

fucked it in my opinion not that it was

even all that great leading up to that

either and I fucking hate saying that

because I

leacy what the vision for this movie was

and what it could have been but it

doesn't get there it doesn't make it

doesn't reach its mark I think it fails

in building tension because it keeps

throwing in humor occasionally that

breaks it up completely throws off the

pacing and the tension just doesn't work

because not even the bad people seem to

be taking the situation seriously enough

either and the bad people are laughably

generic they make the goofy stock horn

noises right like zombies that's

literally what they do that is the noise

they make they don't speak save for one

important character but otherwise it's

and then making you know scary faces

that's very generic I don't understand

the praise for how scary the movie gets

or how tense it gets cuz it doesn't get

there in my opinion it's hard for the

audience to get a sense of you know

uneasiness when even the characters seem

to lose that during the scenes for

example without spoiling anything during

a home invasion segment main character

the little girl and the little boy beat

to death to bad people they are

immediately okay about it as they watch

a new segment over one of the dead

bodies that is bleeding all over the

place and then they start joking about

their kill count before they get into a

car as they are being hunted by someone

right in front of them they're making

jokes about how many kills each of them

have that tonally it's all over the

place

it like it almost feels like maybe more

of a dark comedy than a horror I don't

really know but it's it's just it

doesn't really meet any of its marks I

will say that humor lands more times

than it misses but I thought this was

supposed to be more of a horror movie

and that's what everyone's saying it is

it's like a real horror movie this is

like a a big horror would be so much

more horrifying than get out and it's

not this movie is very goofy very

generic when it comes to horror the only

thing creative about it is its concept

that it literally ruins at the end of

the movie it's just a big disappointment

let's plug this shit into the moist

meter

I'm giving us a 50% I don't think it is

a bad movie I certainly wouldn't say

it's a bad one but if you're a fan of

get out or if you're a fan of horror

movies

it's nothing shy it's nothing more than

just average and okay it's not I don't

think my time was wasted watching it

but god damn it it's a fucking shame I

really thought in the concept on paper

it could have been much better but

anyway let's toss this shit over on to

detective Jackson Clarke who's got some

big fucking news for that ass hey there

folks

Jackson chief investigator of water

related murders here have you ever

wanted to solve a murder

right now there's a new service hot on

the streets lets you accomplish that

very thing Hunter Killer is a fantastic

murder mystery subscription box that is

delivered to your door each month

weaving an interesting storyline on a

monthly basis that constantly evolves

along with your investigation this thing

is perfect for all kinds of nights game

nights date nights our river in the

lonely nights that us grizzled

detectives are used to I've personally

thoroughly enjoyed the fun that comes

with hunter killer and would

wholeheartedly recommend it if you're

into true crime or even if you just like

a good puzzle the immersion of the game

is really impressive it's almost like an

escape room in a box you'll have to

track suspects movements listen to audio

recordings link documents together solve

codes and cyphers and even let the deep

obsession with the case tear at your

relationships ending your long lasting

marriage and just like any good

detective you can even keep all of the

evidence from the crime as a makeshift

collectible this is also an exclusive

club with only 200 lucky detectives

being allowed access each day but

luckily for our listeners Hunter Killer

is letting every listener get in on the

action plus you can get 20% off your

first box if you're as good as a

detective as I think you are you'll be

out of trace the deal back to hunt a

killer calm slash moist and use code

all heard of cold cases before but this

isn't a cold case this is a moist case

Moist Meter | Devil May Cry 5

initiating moisture I'm a huge fan of

the Devil May Cry series I've played

every single game including two and I

even like the DMC reboot and you can

hold my 6.5 inch penis because the game

is good the gameplay is very good in

that game and it's a game that shouldn't

be taken seriously and as long as you

don't take it seriously there's a lot to

like about it without out of the way

let's look at Devil May Cry 5 the newest

entry in the franchise I really fucking

liked it I liked it a lot but there are

a couple of things I didn't like about

it but let's just get into things I

fucking loved about it I love the style

I always loved the Devil May Cry style

it is so goddamn beautiful to look at

and I love the over-the-top goofy

cutscenes with cheesy moments not the

dialogue I think the dialogue is

insufferably bad where it goes from just

cheesy to downright embarrassing to give

you an example of that there's a

verbatim a scene where Nico who is a new

character introduced in the game picks

up a devil part a dismembered part of a

devil and Nero says do you know where

that's been

- which Nico says up your butt I mean

like that's not cheesy that's not like

tongue in cheek that's not like so bad

it's good that's a holy shit this makes

me want to take a fucking sledgehammer

to my PC because I just heard that it's

embarrassing to listen to it points I

know I said I was gonna talk about the

shit I fucking loved but that I

immediately started talking about the

thing I hate the most which is the awful

script in this game anyway I love the

visuals in this game and they set up

some beautiful set pieces nice

environments and the cutscenes are

glorious with such goofiness such

over-the-top testosterone badass moment

you know a fucking van flipping over the

goddamn mystery machines flipping around

Nero's flipping around shooting demons

fucking farting on demons it's great I

absolutely love this style since I've

already brought up the complaint I'll go

ahead and touch on that now the script

the dialogue and this is insufferably

bad it's not like a self-aware bad at

least it doesn't seem like it at least

not throughout there are moments that

are very clearly self-aware but like

Nico for example her entire character is

built around awful awful awful dialogue

she's my least favorite character in the

game my least favorite character

any game I played recently I couldn't

stand listening to her she she could

have been a cool character I like what

she does look at the you know the making

the arms the driving the Mystery Machine

you know being like this crazy driver

this loose cannon a wild card I like

that about her but every time she spoke

it was embarrassing like I felt like a

fucking idiot playing the game all of

the characters just have super shitty

dialogue another example is V who's

another new character whose entire

shtick is reading edgy poetry from a

book and it's always the same poems

ripping tearing the flesh the mother

earth the mirth it's silly but it's not

like this self-aware fun cheesiness

we've come to expect from the Devil May

Cry series where it seems like they know

that it's silly and they want us to know

that it's silly so we're all in on the

joke and here it feels like we're not in

on the joke and they've committed so far

to the joke that it just becomes fucking

awful that's by far my biggest complaint

about the game it's just an incredibly

awful script horrible dialogue but there

are moments in it that are good like

there's some self-aware moments that I

think are executed well such as Dante

doing the the fucking moon walk the

entire Michael Jackson routine for like

30 seconds and then they never touch on

that again it's as if it didn't happen

and it was done so well and I really

like how they played after it I've

really enjoyed that that's when it was

self-aware cheesy and fun but that's so

few and far between sandwiched in

between this awful fucking dialogue and

then there's just goddamn bird that Vee

has that sounds like Gilbert Godfried if

his nuts got caught in a wood chipper

and his lines are super bad too it's

just all the dialogue is just not good

it's really not and that's the biggest

complaint that's really the only big

flaw in this game because the gameplay

smooth as ass cheeks the most hairless

of ass cheeks I love it

each character you plays three you get

Nero VIII Dante throughout the story

each one has different little gimmicks

different mechanics if for example

Nero's got the devil breaker and he gets

to swap in new arms that have new

abilities that you can combo off of and

make interesting things happen he's also

got the exceed gauge which is when you

perfectly time a left trigger input you

can fill it up and get some power more

powerful attacks longer attacks he uses

his animals to attack his Panther his

immortal blob

oyel his fucking it looks like muck is a

Pokemon you get your Bert well it

doesn't look like muck at all it's just

a giant fucking glob of oil to

invincible you get a panther that and

then the bird and that's cool the way

they attack together with the synergy

and then Dante gets to seamlessly

switching between weapons and stances

and guns throughout his combo so it's

real flashy the gameplay is absolutely

superb perhaps some of the best in this

series honestly I really enjoyed

stringing together a lot of unique

combos son of Sparta mode was incredibly

difficult for me when usually it was

kind of a pushover in the past games in

my opinion maybe I'm just rusty at hack

& slash but here I really struggle

getting through the game on it which is

a good thing it's just a really fun game

it's a really really really well done

hack and slash game the soundtrack I

liked for the most part but I've

honestly got to say I don't think it was

as good as previous entries in the

series it wasn't nearly as rememberable

it just it kind of just fell flat for me

and a lot of points and not you know

it's not bad by any means it's it's

nowhere near what I would call bad but I

honestly think DMC reboot soundtrack

with Kombi Christ

I think the MDM c3 soundtrack I think

both of those are the highlights of the

franchise in terms of its sound I think

both of those games have a far superior

soundtrack than this game does though

this one's not bad it just didn't hold a

candle to those two classic soundtracks

and I'm not trying to frame this as a

negative thing because it's not it is a

very good soundtrack still I'm just

can't help but to be disappointed that

it didn't reach the level I was hoping

it would now the only actual other

complaint I have is narrative Lee the

game's a bit weak Devil May Cry never

been a game series to me that's had the

extremely strong narratives I think it's

had strong characters Virgil and Dante

Trish lady I think they've been strong

characters but narrative Lee it hasn't

been the most sound to me and in this

game narrative Lee it's also pretty

fucking weak the ending to this game I

think is incredibly shitty I think the

game has a super shit

lazy ending that I don't want to spoil

anything of but it's like some super

anime cliche shit that I don't really

think has a place in the franchise I

really didn't enjoy the ending and a lot

of events leading up to it I didn't care

for either it's not a bad story by any

means but it's definitely not a story

that's very good either it's a very

lackluster story lazy story let's go

ahead and plug this shit into the moist

meter I'm giving Devil May Cry 5 and 80%

I think it is a very very very good hack

and slash game that I think most people

that are fans of the franchise are

already getting but if you're still on

the fence you absolutely should play it

it's a fucking great game you might want

to play it muted during cutscenes though

so you don't accidentally hear some

dialogue that's it so yeah

Moist Meter | Captain Marvel

initiating moisture there's a lot of

controversy surrounding Captain Marvel I

don't give a shit about any of it we're

not gonna talk about it or touch on it

we're just gonna look at the movie and

see if it was a good fucking movie or

not so the movie's main character is

Captain Marvel as you would expect from

the title of the film Captain Marvel

she's not a very good character

unfortunately I don't think she's bad

and I even think brie Larson does a

great job with the character but it

seems like she doesn't really have a

personality of her own

there's nothing memorable about her as a

character her powers are pretty fucking

cool and I think they did a great job

was showing how strong the character is

physically from a powers perspective at

least at the end of the movie up until

then it was very lackluster with its

action and showing Captain Marvel doing

shit and the action in this movie is my

biggest complaint it was some of the

worst action in any Marvel movie I've

seen rivaling even Ant Man and the wasp

in terms if it's lazy uninteresting

action I'd rather watch two fucking

action figures colliding than half the

shit on the screen because at least it

wasn't it wouldn't be as nauseating

watching action figures collide in this

movie I was goddamn sick during some of

the fight scenes the shakey cam was

unbearable it seemed like every fucking

camera operator was undergoing a seizure

while filming every action scene it was

bad I absolutely despised the action

scenes and they weren't even good from a

choreography perspective they weren't

even flashy they were just bad in an

eyesore honestly and that's a shame when

it's a superhero movie where the action

is always what it leads up to you have a

fucking superhero that's about to

superfish some assholes with their power

and in here you you didn't look forward

to that at this movies at its best when

it's not giving you action and it's

giving you a little buddy cop movie

between Samuel Jackson Nick Fury and

Captain Marvel brie Larson I think the

chemistry between those two is great

even though it's really just Sam

carrying the conversations but even

still it's fun to watch them banter back

and forth there's a cool cat that comes

into play that I thought was a good

character I thought the cat was just

gonna be a gimmicky bullshit thing but

it turned out it was a character that I

liked and I thought was used well from a

story perspective

it's as cliche as it gets this is the

most cliche superhero movie I think I've

ever seen in my life this is like some

mid-90s Saturday morning cartoon level

of cheese and not that that's

necessarily a bad thing but everything

this movie does is has been done before

and done much better by other superhero

movies I think Wonder Woman is a

stronger character than Captain Marvel I

think they're very similar in terms of

how they were portrayed in their movies

but Wonder Woman was significantly more

interesting significantly better of a

character than Captain Marvel I also

don't like the gimmick of the main

character suffering from amnesia not

knowing her past then you slowly piece

it together as to how they got there I

don't like that

just start with all the knowledge out

there and then give us some fun I don't

like where the character is drastically

weakened and we have to go a whole movie

getting back to where they were at the

very start or figuring out how they got

there I don't like that shit that's a

pet peeve I don't think they do amnesia

poorly in here they it's not well done

but I don't think it's bad it's just

very generic it's they very slowly

pieced the puzzle pieces together and Oh

what do you know the most expected

outcome is what you're left with the

story is incredibly predictable the

villains incredibly predictable honestly

there's nothing in this movie from like

a narrative perspective that's gonna

capture anyone's interest now this is

not to say that it's bad because it's

not it's just so average expected

predictable safe it's just it's

forgettable it's unfortunately very very

forgettable where you don't regret

seeing it because there are some good

moments in this movie I definitely think

there are some good moments for sure

none of them involving fights because

all of those suck ass but towards the

end of the movie there's some cool shit

that goes on I think some of the

characters are strong especially Samuel

Jackson's character and also there's a

scroll character in here that I think is

very well fleshed out and developed I

just think this whole movie was super

super formulaic

hey I know Marvel has a formula that

we've all come to expect but they always

put a nice little spin on it whether

it's the visuals whether it's the humor

whether it's a twist in the story

something this

has none of that there is none of that

here this is just as if a fucking Google

AI experiment was tasked to make the

most by-the-numbers superhero movie it

could this would be the result and

that's unfortunate to say because I

think Captain Marvel is a really cool

character conceptually and I do like the

character I just don't think the

character really shines in this movie at

all maybe in a Fender Avengers in game

she will but here it's just in a super

forgettable movie that I don't think

anyone's gonna remember going into in

game they'll have to go back REE watch

this and figure out who the fuck Captain

Marvel is and how she got there yeah I

mean that's that's about all I have to

say about that I mean even the sound I

was expecting like perhaps a good score

even I'd settle for like a better

soundtrack than other Marvel movies but

you didn't get that everything here is

predictably Marvel but below Marvel

standards honestly it doesn't quite

reach the good Marvel movies it's like

right smack dab in the middle Marvel

movies this is like early Marvel movies

this would be like in the you know the

fucking early phases of the Marvel

Cinematic Universe this would be smack

dab in there and that's unfortunate

considering this was supposed to be a

heavy hitter and setting up this crazy

powerful character so it's a bit of a

letdown that the movie to showcase all

that was so forgettable let's plug this

shit into the moist meter I'm giving

Captain Marvel a 65 percent again to

reiterate it's not a bad movie it is

extremely predictable with some good

moments but the action is never one of

those good moments I can't stress that

enough

I really despised when anything was

fucking happening on screen that can be

even misconstrued as action it was so

poorly done I don't know what kind of

fucking filming techniques they learned

in school but that school needs to just

be abolished get it out of here that

school is a goddamn crime against ice if

they're teaching their students to film

movie action scenes like this one here

it's bad I really I really didn't like

the action that's it so yeah

Moist Meter | Anthem

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter anthem fuckin sucks spoiler alert

I needed to get that out of the way

right away this is the biggest chore of

a game I've ever experienced in my life

I would honestly rather be scrubbing

public urinals with a toothbrush than

going through the looting shooting grind

fest of repetitive objectives that this

game is and it's not even really a game

it's borderline unplayable with its

loading screens angry Joe posted this

tweet that illustrates exactly what

every mission is like more loading

screen more time and loading screen than

act an actual game that's unacceptable

for a modern game it's completely

fucking broken in a lot of people

compare it to warframe but to that I say

warframe at least have fun gameplay to

back up the repetitive nature of its

missions and its grinding and this

doesn't have that component at all the

gameplays extremely stiff extremely

bland it's so incredibly mind-numbing ly

fucking brain-dead to play that I

couldn't do it

I stopped after eight hours of playing

anthem so I'm gonna toss this over to

Jackson the masochist that he is he

managed to endure 1215 plus hours of

this incredibly awful experience to

really get under the meat and that

scrotum of this game and figure out what

the fuck happened and how Bioware could

have made something so incredibly

hostile to the human intellect to insult

it to this level that anthem does it is

a goddamn train wreck Jackson take it

away

so yeah anthem sucks this is without a

doubt of one of the most unenjoyable

Triple A games I think I've ever played

between this and 4076 I think I'd take

fallout 76 because at least it was fun

to make fun of that garbage with friends

I want to get the biggest rebuttal of

criticism I've noticed online out of the

way first the you know you hate EA

that's why you hate this game you wanted

it to be bad

I really didn't this is the kind of game

that should appeal to me I love looter

shooters especially ones with so-called

shared online experiences I've put

hundreds possibly thousands of hours

into destiny and while they're evidently

not even close to being similar it still

fit that genre mould that I thought I

would enjoy and the other note of hating

EA has to mean hating this game is just

a stupid

my favorite and also Charlie's favorite

games at the moment is apex legends

which is also published by ei difference

being of course that is well-designed

fun and also functional so pretty much

the direct opposite of anthem

I'll get my main piece of criticism with

the game out of the way first and this

is one Charlie briefly touched on its

the loading screens no one game has had

this many loading screens this game has

a very clear fetish for loading screens

I'd wager you're gonna spend about two

to three minutes on each loading screen

and that wouldn't be a problem to me if

it was just one loading screen each time

you played but it's not totally it takes

about three loading screens on average

before you get to any actual gameplay so

there's a loading screen to there social

hub which is called for Tarsus is pretty

much worn up there social hub there game

play hub which is where you go around

it's like missions and talk to vendors

and stuff so there's a loading screen to

get into that then there's a loading

screen or when you hop into your javelin

to customize that full of missions so

that's to change your weapons your your

armor inscriptions change the color of

your soup and there's a loading screen

to hop out of that into the like

missions selection screen which is where

you can rally up with your friends and

choose a mission or free roam or

whatever you want to do then there's an

absolutely massive loading screen into

the actual game world which is where you

run around and shoot you know the

general the general game and so once you

get into the game world if you're lucky

as lucky as I was you're gonna spawn

into a mission in progress which means

the game will give you about 20 seconds

to fly to your teammates which most of

the time it's just not possible as that

on the other side of the map before it

teleports you to them this is just fancy

talk for yet another fuckin loading

screen listen this makes the game

roughly 1,000 times more frustrating to

play because it gives me time to think

on each loading screen about how much of

a joke this game is and how I should be

playing other far better games now that

you've slept through the loading screens

or done your taxes or whatever other

time-consuming tasks you can find to do

while you wait you'd at least expect the

gameplay to be worth the wait right well

to a certain degree the actual gameplay

and gunplay isn't bad it's there's a

fair amount of variety and abilities and

skills and while most of them amount to

nothing more than slight stat boosts to

specific damage types it's not a

horrible system not something that I can

outright pinpoint as being bad

what is horrible is the goddamn mission

design never have I experienced such an

uninspired and lazy mission design in

any of these types of games each mission

and I mean each and every mission boils

down to kill enemies listen to cheesy

one-liner from a character you feel

nothing about contempt for go to a new

area to kill the same enemies in listen

to another snarky line and then

protected bacon or something ad nauseam

until the mission ends it's always some

mixed match of this formula that's it

the enemies are all the same they're all

incredibly lazy and boring to fight it's

not fun the combat itself works but that

doesn't make it fun my other major gripe

with the game is that the story is

nothing special

every character feels like they're

putting on this weird stage performance

with lots of overacting that really

takes me out of the experience no other

characters are remotely likable the

antagonist of the game shows up for

about 5 minutes of screen time and does

something you know mustache twirling Lee

evil in that time so we know he's a bad

medicine guy that we must defeat or kill

whatever but not much else is discovered

that there's there's a sufficient amount

of world building and law I suppose but

I'm not really a fan of how they deliver

that to you all in all it feels is

generally uninspired and dull much like

the rest of the game there is a story

here though and I would wager it lasts

about eight hours but probably more with

how much they managed the length in the

game in the middle with an absolutely

ridiculous quest line the gates you are

for finishing the story by forcing you

to do a checklist of World of Warcraft

esque mission objectives things like

repair three friends open 15 loot chests

kill X amount of enemies in this

specific way etc very boring quest line

obviously to lengthen the main story

time to something more respectable the

end game revolves around doing the same

missions over and over again in this

game's hardest missions which are

basically just longer normal missions

with the boss at the end the bosses

don't have any interesting mechanics to

just bullet sponges who sometimes run

away and then you have to wait around

killing ads before they show up again I

really don't know how this game took

five years to make

yes games are hard to make and I fully

understand there was a lot of passion

and talented developers at Bioware and I

really don't like saying this but I

didn't see any passion or talent in this

game this game feels wholly like a game

that was developed entirely within a

boardroom

even worse it feels like those board

members actually took up the keyboard to

code this shit because I had so many

bugs and disconnections it was

remarkable

this ranged from funny funny goofy

visual bugs where a teammate would spawn

without a head to frustrating tear out

my hair bugs like I would miss an entire

cutscene because of a crash and I'd

never be able to watch the cutscene

again without YouTube kind of thing to

pure rage because after five minutes of

loading screens the third and final

loading screen would hang up and get

stuck at 95% and I'd have to alt f4

restart the game and go through the

previous two long arse loading screens

only for it to happen again

goddamnit this game is barely functional

so yes I don't know how this games with

five years to make this feels like a

game that took eighteen months at the

most to make especially with how little

loot there is in this game in a ludus

shooter this is one of the worst

offenses you could make each gun type

has about three models and even the

highest tier of weapons use these models

just with skin and color differences

there are only about three suits for

each javelin in the entire game the suit

the javelins being the suits that you

you jump into to fight you know that the

big iron man looking things and as far

as I can tell there's only three suits

for each of them one is given to you at

the start of the game so it's just a

it's just the vanilla suit that you get

the second is a pre-order bonus so you

have to pay for that you have to

pre-order the game to unlock it yeah the

third is bought with in-game currency so

the gold that gets given to you through

missions or whatever the amount of gold

you need to unlock that is rather large

so it would take some time to unlock the

third suit so that's kind of cool I

guess so yeah three suits to make

yourself visually different from

everyone else that's apparently the best

they could come up with with their

five-year development time I honestly

cannot think of a single good thing

apart from maybe the soundtrack and I

would be fully prepared to score this

game under 15% on the moist meter if it

weren't for the sometimes nice visuals

as well as the nice soundtrack but again

there nothing remarkable or great

they're just elevated above just being

average because everything else in this

game is genuinely trashed

I could keep going on about all the

floors in this game but I don't think

there's enough harddrive space at

YouTube HQ to host a video of that size

so I'll keep it short the game is

it's unenjoyable foreplay I wanted

desperately to do anything else other

than play the game while I was there and

that sucks because by our way used to be

one of my favorite developers all right

so putting this on the moist meter and

this is the first time I get to do this

putting this on the moist meter we're

giving this one a 20% with a strong

recommendation not to buy this game

until some serious work is put into it

but even then I don't think they can

really patch out the issues this game

has it just suffers from a clear lack of

passion and at times Talent anyway

that's it from me yeah thanks for

watching and we'll see you next time

this has been Jackson with an Charlie at

Moyes meter HQ

Moist Meter | Happy Death Day 2U

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're looking at the new

happy deathday it's not as good as the

first one I don't mean to come out of

here you know hitting you with the naked

man giving you the goods right away I'm

not trying to come out here guns blazing

but I am disappointed with the movie and

you should know it's not as good as at

first when it's really not I really

liked the first one caught me by

surprise I expected it to be shitty

turned out to be really good this one

it's not that it goes in a completely

different direction the first one was

more about a self-aware pseudo horror

slasher movie that was just kind of

emotional and fun this one is entirely

nothing to do with anything horror or

slasher related and it's more about

science romantic comedy and that's a

huge step down in my opinion but it's

not like they do a bad job with it in

fact Jessica Roth really fucking carries

this movie she's absolutely fantastic

here she sells so well the emotional

moments in this movie as well is just

the fun I really enjoyed her character I

think she does a great job so it doesn't

miss it does the comedy well it does the

emotion well albeit for a few you know

cringy shitshow steps here but overall

they do a pretty decent job it's just

it's not that much fun to watch in this

scenario where the main focus is this

romance and then science to sum up the

plot she get stuck in another time loop

and she wants to get back to another

dimension because she's accidentally

transferred dimensions she used to exist

in the Berenstein bears now she's in the

berenstain bears and wants to get the

fuck out and then she has to go about

getting out of there and it's mainly

about her learning these algorithms and

telling these people how to get them

back get her back it's really just a lot

of science that you know if you start

picking apart the plot makes no fucking

sense at all

but it's not that big of a deal because

you have to suspend your disbelief for a

movie like this anyway but what the

first one had that this doesn't is that

ambiguity of who is the killer she's

being hunted who's doing this why and

this doesn't have that it just says oh

there's a killer here that sometimes

kills her but nine

times in this movie she just kills

herself albeit she does it in creative

and entertaining ways because it's

self-aware shit like she goes skydiving

him to Keaney on a bikini and then just

fucking explodes on the ground in front

of her bitchy sorority friend so I mean

there are entertaining moments in it

like I said it does the comedy well and

there's a lot of emotional moments that

it does really well to that I can't

touch on without spoiling it but it's

just kind of a letdown to not have any

of the first ones fun little slasher

mystery guessing shit anytime they do

attempt to do that in this movie it's

really poorly done like the most generic

horror movie slasher shit you could

imagine going on she's in a room with

baby masks everywhere and then you think

she's about to find him at the end of

the the end of the baby mask hallway and

then all of a sudden he's not there and

it turns out he was actually right next

to her in one of the baby masks

it's like boring it's super fucking

boring and it's a letdown there but like

I said Jessica Roth carries the shit out

of this movie it is a really decent

movie entirely because it's Jessica Roth

I wouldn't consider this a bad movie I

wouldn't it does romance it does comedy

well but it just is a lot worse than the

first one and there is a ton of plot

holes here that I don't think anyone's

gonna really care about going into a

movie like this but if you've seen the

first one and you liked the first one I

can't imagine you'll like the direction

it takes here but anyway let's plug this

shit into the moist meter I'm giving

happy death day to you a 50% it's a fun

little rom-com for Valentine's Day I

guess if you're trying to get a little

over-the-pants hand job in the movie

theater I guess it could serve that

purpose but otherwise if you're a fan of

the first one you're not gonna walk away

from this one as excited or happy about

seeing this and that's a shame because I

thought the first one is creative this

one's just I don't know it's kind of

just a misguided that's it see ya

Moist Meter | Alita: Battle Angel

initiating moisture this is a big moment

for the moist meter where I come out

here and eat some shit and say I was

wrong when I first saw previews for a

liter battle angel I thought it off

immediately I wasn't very interested in

the movie I thought it was gonna be

pretty boring and not very good and then

it rolls around to releasing and I go in

there with no expectations and I was

blown away I just got home and I wanted

to immediately make this moist meter to

say how fucking wrong I was about this

this is the biggest surprise I've ever

had when going into a movie with

expectations this low and seeing just

how good the product was I'm having a

hard time putting it into words but my

dick was just fucking throbbing this

entire movie it was such an incredible

film I can't recommend it enough this is

the most anime shit I have ever seen on

the big screen this is more anime than

the Dragon Ball super movie that just

came out this movie fucking blows that

out of the water this movie is so

goddamn entertaining I'm gonna go ahead

and get the things that I didn't care

for out of the way right now so I can't

continue to just gush in one straight

urine stream of compliments acting some

characters just totally fall flat there

are some mediocre characters at best in

here and some pretty stilted dialogue

and it's you're gonna recognize that for

sure a lot of people probably won't care

for the main character design the big

guys will probably turn a lot of people

off and a lot of people are already

turned off by it for me personally I

think it worked well with the character

and it was done well another big con

that I would point out is maybe this

story's pretty cliche for a lot of

people and maybe it is a bit

oversimplified and it also really

strives to set itself up for more in the

universe which I like but it does feel

like it kind of focuses too hard on

setting up these things that'll play

into movies later down the line assuming

this movie does well which I really hope

it does because this movie deserves it

this is the most visually beautiful well

tied for the most visually beautiful

movie I've ever seen

tied with Blade Runner 2049 that is

great company to be in I just hope it

does better financially than Blade

Runner

20:49 but one more con about this movie

until I get into all the pros

the main villain I think is a little

weak and it's probably just because they

didn't really explore him that well and

it seems like his motivation is just the

most comically ridiculous cartoon

supervillain I am evil because I want to

be evil that's about this deep as I got

into his motives for everything that he

does and everything that happens here so

that's a pretty fucking weak in my

opinion but now to the to the pros which

are there's many this like I said is

genuinely beautiful to look at but the

action the action in the way it's

presented is like nothing I've ever seen

before the choreography here is

beautiful with moves I couldn't even

fucking imagine that makes kung fu

movies look like amateurs it's so flashy

and it feels like so impactful every

haymaker

Elita throws it feels like that would

break some bones fuck shit up cause some

explosions ever you scissor kick extremo

mode turbo mode kick that she throws

feels like it would just slap the

fucking head off a rhinoceros and it's

coupled with this great sound design

that sound like you just listened to

Godzilla get the shit kicked out of them

or a giant transformer get just

brutalized oh my god and the characters

the character design in this movie is

amazing

you'll have some like generic looking

robot cyborg characters looking like

fucking chappie on his day off and then

you'll have these like crazy intricately

designed cyborgs that kind of blur the

line between human and machine that just

looks so badass just so incredibly

fucking cool if you've seen red line

which is that poster I have behind me it

looks like some of the characters look

like machine head from that cart from

that movie which is a very big positive

because I think that's great character

design every character in this movie

that isn't just like a normal human

looks fantastic and is so fucking cool

with these great weapons there's a like

fucking extendo go-go-gadget

claws that shoot out and just eviscerate

opponents and they have this incredibly

fun sport and that's something I want to

talk about this shit is so like early

90s extreme zone that the movie has this

like brutal sport that is played for

entertainment that used to be a common

thing with like you know Spy Kids it

goes extreme in the video game world

they have this sport called motor ball

which is a deathmatch where you have a

ball that you score in a whoo

and you try and kill your opponent

before they score the ball in the hoop

and that every single time that was on

was so fucking cool and they have these

beautiful fucking weapons this movie I

could gush about this shit for so long

I've never left the movie theater as

excited as I was about this one because

like I said it sets up a sequel and I

really hope to see more from it but man

it was so fucking good it was it was

really good really good can't recommend

it enough I could go on and on and on

but the best the biggest takeaway is

that it is a genuinely beautiful movie

to look at it seems like the budget was

massive I read that at one point it was

like 200 million dollars but it got

stuck in a development hell so I don't

know what the budget actually was but it

seems like it was a huge budget movie

and I really really hope that it turns a

profit because it deserves it absolutely

stunning

and whoever choreographed the action and

whoever fucking framed the action and

came up with the way they presented

needs to win a fucking award because

I've never seen it executed so well as

it was in this movie I felt like I was

genuinely watching some incredibly

over-the-top action that I could keep up

with without shakey cam or all of these

cuts it wasn't completely cut every

single time something was happening it

was just smooth shots you got to process

everything take it all in so fucking fun

plugging moist meter for a liter battle

angel giving this shit a nice 90 that's

a lot higher than most of the limp-dick

critics are giving it their shitting on

it for cliches and you know there are

definitely flaws and I talked about them

a little bit but yeah it's a flawed

movie in certain aspects but I've never

seen a movie like this that was his fun

as this movie was also the relationship

between the main character and the love

interest I thought was pretty decent it

wasn't like super developed but it was

cute it was wholesome so there's even a

little wholesome moments of filler in

between some fucking neck-breaking dick

popping action absolutely great movie I

cannot recommend this one enough that's

it see ya

Moist Meter | The Prodigy

initiating moisture modern horror movies

suck shit but they're always

entertaining to watch in my opinion

welcome to the moist meter today we're

looking at the prodigy the latest modern

horror movie this one's actually not

nearly as bad as most of the other big

ones this movie is two movies in my

opinion there is a good horror movie

which is the first half of the movie and

then there's a generic shit show horror

movie which is the second half of the

movie the premise is super interesting

boy gets a unwanted reincarnated visitor

inside his mind and then he asked the

battle to control the body and the

parents have to decide whether or not

that's their son or a serial killer

that's inhabiting his body it's a really

interesting premise I really enjoy the

premise and I really like the first half

of this movie it does a great job of

building some tension it pulls no

punches it gets creepy it seems very

mean-spirited and then the second half

is WOW look at everything we took from

every other horror movie of the last 20

years that you guys don't like you guys

aren't happy about that what do you mean

movie fucking sucks in the second half

I'm just gonna get that out of the way

but in the first half uses some

genuinely creepy moments some good

tension building moments it's really I

mean if this movie just had the same

intensity in the same direction as the

first half this would be a pretty

goddamn good horror movie on par with

hereditary in my opinion the creepy

child horror movie thing is nothing new

but the premise of having it be a

reincarnated serial killer like an

actual human soul instead of a evil

demon out here looking for blood common

tits that's a nice spin on it to not

just go that route and they do it really

well the acting is pretty good as well

they sell the performances the father's

performance was kind of weak in my

opinion he's just that standard like

rock hard my son ain't no other dude my

son's my dude and he likes to might be a

weirdo but he's my dude and with every

other character it's an actual

performance that they deliver instead of

just this caricature of masculine man

one thing I really well is a lot I

didn't like about the second half but

one thing I don't like in like the first

half of the movie well I guess it's in

the second half kind of is that you know

the dog is gonna get killed

spoiler alerts anytime a horror movie

has a dog in it it's getting fucking

murdered and I hate that it's such a

cheap lazy way of making the audience

feel like damn that's some evil shit

it is so goddamn generic and tired I

don't know why they keep using dog

deaths to cement the idea of bad guy you

shouldn't like him because you just

fucked that dog up real good so cheap

they need to think of a different trope

to beat to death I'm so tired of them

just killing dogs

it's so fucking upsetting and so lazy

that they keep using that that shit has

been a staple in horror movies for at

least the last 30 or so years at least I

don't know why they can't try and think

of something else to make the character

this is evil obviously the character is

evil you don't need to have this dog

that everyone from the beginning of the

movie knows is gonna get killed by the

evil thing so it's so tired of that one

I could rant about that for a while but

I'm not going to first half of the movie

good second half of the movie bad that's

I mean I'm not gonna get into why it's

so bad in the second half without

spoiling too much it has a shit ending

like a real shit ending they the whole

movie towards the second half really

seems to just want to make the audience

upset like yeah we're not afraid to be

real dark by copying other horror movies

I just don't get it

I really don't they had something really

nice in the first half that they shit on

shit all over in the second half one

thing I want to come in though is the

jump scares in the first half of the

movie and I don't care for jump scares I

don't think anyone does they're not

scary it's just startling but here they

used a few jump scares really well that

I didn't expect and I thought were

really well executed to really cement

the idea of that might not be your kid

or maybe it is it plays with the

audience and I think that was really

good with how they use those scares

overall the movie is better than most

modern horror movies and it could have

been a lot better if they didn't you

know how switch directors or something

at the second half of this film let's

plug this shit into the moist meter I'm

giving this a 40 percent I don't think

they switch directors by the way I guess

the

just decided he was didn't want to make

something good or some shit couldn't

tell you but the movie is not bad it's

not a bad horror movie it really isn't

it just falls apart absolutely falls

apart at the end and that that's it so

yeah

Moist Meter | Apex Legends

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter when it comes to online reviewing

of shit it's basically a battle royale

except we're the undisputed unanimous

winner of this battle royale the moist

meter is the king the only one you can

trust and today we're turning our

omniscient gaze towards apex legends

it's the newest condom tossed atop the

pile of condoms known as the battle

royale genre and this one's made by a

developer that I have a lot of respect

for this is made by respawn of titanfall

Fame in collaboration with EA I don't

know if EA helped they might have just

like farted in the office and call today

I'm really not sure what role EA is

played in it but it's published through

EA who nobody likes no one has respect

for me included but I'm happy to say

that it is a good battle royale game at

the time of recording this I have 12

wins and about 15 hours worth of

gameplay I'm basically the fucking

Shroud of Apex legends if shroud didn't

also play apex legends now I don't know

if this is something respawn really was

passionate about making or if EA just

shoved their micro dick down the throat

of respawn and forced them to abandon

titanfall to make this one there's

really no telling but respawn made a

quality battle royale product here and

in this modern day and age making a

battle royale game that doesn't

immediately eat shit and die within the

first three hours of its launch is a

fucking accomplishment in and of itself

that's a fuckin hundred gamer score Xbox

achievement right there so the game does

have legs to stand on and I do think it

has staying power when I initially

played this game on stream twitch.tv

slash moist critical about the first

eight hours of it I considered it a

mediocre battle royale game and honestly

it was very much like a free-to-play

blackout which is black ops 4 is battle

royale mode but as I played more I'm up

to about 1516 hours worth of play time

on it as I played more and really

understood the mechanics more I see that

it's more than a mediocre game it is a

fucking good game though it is still

very much like black out I stand by that

assessment but it is a better battle

royale than black out the gunplay is

tight albeit at times seems a bit

inconsistent with what it considers a

hit also with what

damage does what sometimes you'll

point-blank sewing with a shotgun it'll

do seven damage just off the top like

you just fuckin flicked a booger at them

other times you'll shoot them in the

foot and it does 200 damage with the

same weapon it does seem inconsistent

with what hits and for what damage but

overall it is very tight and responsive

it's a very rewarding style of play if

you're very aggressive then you have

some classes that can help complement

that like the Pathfinder is very good

for some verticality and speed the

Wraith is also very good for some

tactical place to get behind them use

portals and shit it's a really versatile

game using these different classes that

all have different abilities the

abilities are kind of similar to I don't

want to say overwatch shit because it's

not even close but there are abilities

here like in some hero shooters that

really do change the play style for each

classes one thing that works for one

class will not work for another and it's

really nice to figure out what's best

suited for your play style you also are

forced into three-man teams which has

its ups and downs I would like a solo

option but having a three-man team is

nice with the classes because you can

have a nice team comp that complements

each other really well and synergize as

well it also has a really two unique

mechanics that solve a lot of problems

in battle royale games the biggest one

the one that I'm a huge fan of that apex

Legends does is the pinging system the

pinging system allows you to mark an

enemy mark a location you think you guys

should go mark an item you think your

team might want mark where you think a

good bush to take a piss behind is it's

a system that allows you to communicate

with your team if you don't have a mic

and it's also showing exactly where you

want them to look instead of just giving

a vague assessment when you're with your

boys on discord like hey there's a man

eating a chocolate bar right behind that

barrel on the left side and then

everyone's fuckin confused cuz what

barrel are you talking about here you

ping it and they can see the ping and

know exactly what you're talking about

it is a great system that I think every

battle needs going forward it is a game

changer another great system it has is

they have a respawn mechanic and it's a

really well-thought-out one when you die

you go down if you get killed while down

you leave behind a banner that your team

has a little over a minute to claim if

they claim that banner they can take it

to a respawn location and they can

revive you it takes a couple of seconds

for that to go through so you're out in

the open and this respawn point and they

another team can take you out but if no

one does or you out fight them you can

get a teammate back and it's a really

great system if you had an unlucky drop

and you get fucked in the ass because

someone got a better drop than you and

you can just come back if your team's

carrying and you it's good to go it is a

great system both those two systems are

beautiful and really really work well on

this game now let's get to some

shortcomings in the game some of the

weapons are just utterly fucking useless

just absolute unmitigated garbage its

weapons that you should never pick up at

any stage of the game if you were

fucking starving in the desert you came

across the Mozambique and you could

break it apart for water just don't even

fucking do it these weapons such as the

Mozambique do no damage at any range and

are just completely fucking useless and

you're better off using your fists or

spitting on the enemy some weapons are

just generally genuinely awful

absolutely awful and you're better off

not touching them so I think some

weapons need some buffs I don't really

think there's any weapons that are too

strong at the moment except for maybe

the Mastiff but that's a legendary so it

should be pretty rewarding to get but

there are just some weapons that you

would never ever ever want to pick up

the alternator the Mozambique are the

two big ones I can think of off the top

of my head and there's also some classes

that lag behind the others some that are

just significantly less useful in any

composition such as caustic caustic is a

joke caustic is a character that's built

around gas and gas traps so his gas

traps fucking sake just plants a giant

water balloon of fart fumes and it goes

off and does literally one damage it

poisons them for one damage it's useless

I guess you can use it for tagging

enemies but it's really easy to avoid

it's not a huge area it's just

fundamentally awful for tagging and for

also doing damage the only use that

caustic straps have is to slow down the

enemy by making them laugh you plan a

trap the enemy team sees it they stop

for a minute to giggle because they know

you're fucking idiot for choosing

caustic his alt is a giant

area-of-effect gas bomb that when IV all

the times I've used it and I've used it

about 10 times now the most damage I've

gotten out of it is seven it ticks from

one up to seven and it's so fucking

laughable that I just wanted to quit the

game the second I threw it each time

everything in caustics kit is bad

there's no reason any team should ever

have caustic on it by under no

circumstances and the last complaint I

have about Apex and it's nothing that

respawn can help with is EA EA is

fucking servers crash constantly you

know actually I don't know if it's EA

but I'm gonna blame EA because it feels

like it's on their side considering I

get origin errors that just kick me out

of the game sometimes get me back to the

main menu or just cause me to disconnect

randomly

I think that's an EA server-side issue

or some shit I'm really not positive but

it is a big damper on a good good battle

royale game let's go ahead and plug this

shit into the moist meter I'm giving

apex legends a 75% I really do think

this is one of the best battle royale

games out at the moment it is extremely

well done and in 2019 it's something to

celebrate that a game comes out and it

actually fucking works for the most part

this game runs very well works very well

and it's a very well made game which is

rare in this day and age where

everything's fucking early access beta

this is a full release battle royale and

it feels like it it really feels like it

it is a good game very very much worth

playing if you're a fan of the genre

that's it so yeah

Moist Meter | Kingdom Hearts 3

initiating moisture the moist meter has

become synonymous with friendship big

titties and light all things you might

also know from a series called Kingdom

Hearts I'll go ahead and say right now I

haven't played every single Kingdom

Hearts games that spans across fucking

15 different consoles you know the PSP

the mobile game the Gameboy Advance game

the ti-83 game all of these different

Kingdom Hearts games all spanned across

so many different consoles it makes it

hard to play them all and for some

reason all of them are super fucking

important to the overall story so I had

to do my homework before playing Kingdom

Hearts 3 so I long I watched a bunch of

big Kingdom Hearts YouTube video

explanations oh but a bunch of hours of

content to take in and it's overwhelming

but I thought I had a pretty good handle

on it until I played the game now I'd

really like to start with all the things

I liked about the game because I overall

think it's a very good game and I had a

lot of fun with it so before all of you

big-dicked Kingdom Hearts enthusiasts

getting behind your keyboard at the helm

ready with your Kingdom Hearts Bible in

one hand cock and the other all semi

chubs ready to rumble telling me how

because I didn't play thousands of hours

of content across all these consoles I

couldn't possibly grasp the magnitude of

their ingenious storytelling let me tell

you what I liked about the game because

obviously as you can probably tell I

didn't like the writing I didn't like

the story but what I liked is the

gameplay the gameplay felt fluid the

gameplay simple yet fun it keeps it

fresh with all the new key blades of the

second forms that they go into and it's

all very flashy and beautiful to look at

the attraction ride attacks always fun

it's always nice to see them come to

life I uh I really didn't often skip

them because it was just really fucking

fun it was great to look at they're

integrated really well under the combat

it was all seamless there was just a

really flashy fun combat experience that

wasn't too deep but was deep enough to

make it interesting I ran a very strong

magic build that basically spammed

thunder and yet I still had a great time

mixing that shit up as well I also need

to mention the soundtrack the soundtrack

is absolutely beautiful throughout the

entire game every world has beautiful

work done in that department

SCOR fantastic apps some of the best

honestly some of the best I've heard I

it's no the main the main theme it's no

simple and clean but it is still very

good I also really liked most of the

sets

I think the set pieces in the game were

great the boss battles were really

fucking cool if often times confusing

due to so much shit going on at the same

time it was still fun and it never

really felt like everything clashed too

hard you could always pretty much tell

what was going on even in the most

chaotic circumstances I just really had

a good time with the combat every time

that you got to do some combat and

unfortunately it wasn't all that often

the game is comprised mainly of

cutscenes it's about 80% cutscenes to

20% gameplay but when you were doing the

gameplay it was really rewarding and

enjoyable and there was a lot of

different items that you could mix

around and just a good fucking time and

I wish there was more gameplay to be had

going across the story you could

obviously go out of your way to do some

secret bosses do some grinding and shit

like that and get more gameplay out of

it but if you're just straight shooting

the story your time is mainly going to

be spent watching movies that you've

already seen now we're gonna get to the

criticisms I have of the game and it's

not the overabundance of cutscenes I

really don't mind that the game was

broken up into so many cutscenes it's a

lot of content and if it could tell a

really good story I would have loved it

but it didn't now the biggest complaint

I have is the world's most of them

actually half of them it's dishonest to

say most because half of the worlds are

just watching movies Disney movies

you've already seen in the tangled world

you just watch the tangled movie unfold

in front of you and they'll occasionally

mention Sora Donald and Goofy very

rarely they don't directly impact the

plot of that world everything just

unfolds the same way it did in the movie

for the most part the frozen world is

the same way and the Pirates of the

Caribbean world is the single worst

video game I've video game level I've

played in the modern era of gaming it is

miserable it's comprised entirely of

underwater segments and ship battles

that are so primitive it's laughable

mobile games have deeper ship combat and

it is insulting ly long because you

watch the entire Pirates of the

Caribbean at World's End movie the

entire fucking movie and that even has

the audacity to send you on a mission

where you collect 300

from an island 300 crabs and they're not

in groups of like 200 or anything there

are a couple groups of a big cluster of

them but nothing substantial you still

have to go out of your way on a big

island to collect 300 fucking crabs that

are ultimately meaningless I'm gonna

spoil this for you though you collected

300 crabs you bring them to Jack Sparrow

Jack Sparrow does nothing with the crabs

and you go about your journey and then

you watch the rest of the movie with bad

ship combat occasionally and they'll

occasionally say something like hi to

Sora it I hated that level and I hate

that formula where they wrote a scope a

movie and they just make you watch it in

these worlds in the game I couldn't

stand it

it just seemed pointless now the Toy

Story world was great the Monsters Inc

world was great the big hero 6 world was

great and you know what all those have

in common the characters from Kingdom

Hearts actually play a role in the

narrative that unfolds in those worlds

it had it's self-contained narrative and

it was fun it was enjoyable you you get

to go out of your way and have fun with

these characters in a new adventure that

you haven't already fucking seen before

and it was great and I don't know why

they wouldn't do that for the other

worlds but ultimately everything you do

on the worlds doesn't matter in the

overarching plot I don't want to ruin

Christmas for you Kingdom Hearts fans

but every single world you visit plays

absolutely no role in the outcome of the

game

it is completely meaningless and you

never see them touched again once you

leave that world and let's talk about

the overarching plot it's fucking mess

it is incomprehensible jargon that uses

the word heart and friendship so many

times you forget those words have any

real fucking meaning it is insulting

genuinely spitting in the butthole of

anyone actually wants to fully

understand what's going on because the

writers clearly don't even know what's

going on

there's an entire subplot with the

datascape that is completely disregarded

and thrown away the entire Pirates of

the Caribbean world ends with the bad

guys saying well this was a waste of

time and they poof out of there like

some fuckin Fairly OddParents shit where

they went to the wrong place some shit

is just so useless and is acknowledged

as being useless and I really can't help

but feel that the writers were laughing

when coming up with this like ha ha ha

the players are gonna have to go through

this shit and it's useless to the plot

har-har high fives all around group hug

in the shower tonight boys we got him 13

years for this and I really can't stress

enough just how bad the rioting plus the

voice acting is I feel like the voice

acting performances on their own aren't

bad but for some reason when they're

compiled into the game there's these

awkward long pauses and between things

that just throw it off and make it sound

so bad

it's as if Tommy was Oh wrote the

dialogue and executed it and I know the

previous Kingdom Hearts games were just

like this because Tiana recently

marathon them so I was exposed to a lot

of it again and I did play quite a bit

of the in-game shit as well so I know

it's always been like this but it

doesn't mean it should be excused and

yes at times it is charming to hear Sora

say friendship will power the hearts of

all of those that didn't make the high

school JV basketball team band together

squad we can overcome all the darkness

yes sometimes that's charming but it

really overstays its welcome when every

single fucking cutscene starts with that

or there's a scene where he starts

doubting himself he's like wait a minute

but my dick can get big if I believe

hard enough we can do this Donald and

Goofy

from Donald and Goofy says some cool

shit I actually like goofy but it just

gets such a chore to listen to it and

it's so fucking embarrassing at times

the plot again I can't stress enough

it's just such an incoherent mess of

jumbled fucking diarrhea it's as if the

creator's kids you just took a cran to

to the script and just drew over it and

then they made the best with what they

could decipher from the script they

originally had it's bad and it doesn't

connect at the end it seems like this

game was so consumed with setting up

more Kingdom Hearts games that it just

lost track of making a good conclusion

to those storyline had already had it's

so fucking driven to have all of these

different plot points that don't get

resolved so that way they can set up

something in the future for Kingdom

Hearts 4 and the spin-offs that will

undoubtedly span across every fucking

console will ever be get made it's just

bad I don't know why they wouldn't do

the series justice which with a proper

ending a satisfying conclusion and one

where everything is tied together and

then maybe explore looking

into going forward instead of just

focusing so much on setting up that next

game it's just I've really got upset

with the way the game ended but overall

I have to say I enjoyed my time with the

game I would recommend it because I

think the gameplay is really enjoyable

and unique and the visuals just get

beautiful and becomes such a nice

spectacle I didn't care too much for the

gummi gummi ship sections in the

beginning but then I made my own ship

and the creamer and then the creamer

marked too for when the creamer was

really you know sucking some hard dick I

made the improved version and I had a

lot of fun with the gummi ship shit

after that so I have to say I think the

gummi ship shit was done pretty well and

I just really did enjoy my time with the

game there was a lot of charm a lot to

like and it did have that special little

Disney magic that zaps the tippier penis

let's go ahead and plug this shit into

the moist meter I'm getting I'm giving

Kingdom Hearts 3 a 70% again there are

so many flaws in this game and I read

some that people are blinded by

nostalgia or fear of the fans that they

won't point them out the things that are

objectively bad about the game and I

think that's a shame and I think it's a

shame they're there in the first place

because the game could be great

it could have given a beautiful

conclusion to a beloved story albeit a

very confusing and convoluted mess of a

story they could have worked on making

that clearer and better but they didn't

and narrative Lee it is a disaster but

overall I think the game is fun if you

just want to go in there shut your

fucking brain off and just have some

mindless fun with the combat and some

familiar settings and Disney property so

that's it so yeah

Moist Meter | Resident Evil 2 Remake

initiating moisture it's the moist meter

you fucking pussy and you know what

we're not afraid of a little horror game

so today we're looking at Resident Evil

two's remake and this remake absolutely

puts the shame all other remakes that

have come before it from other video

game developers trying to cash in on

older games with their really shittily

done lazily put together remakes remixes

reignite vibes Rhian visions director

cut all that bullshit where the only

difference is the graphics were improved

by maybe one extra polygons in one tiny

frame of one of the main characters

penises what I'm saying is everything

that you thought you knew about redos of

old games in the modern age well you

know like the HD remixes and shit just

throw that in the shitter it's

completely useless when it comes to

resonate all twos remakes because

everything before this one was so lazily

done in comparison in such a waste of

time that it's just a joke to even put

them on the same playing field as

Resident Evil 2's remake this game is

spectacular a truly ground-up redo of

Resident Evil 2 and it's absolutely

beautiful graphically it's beautiful

from an acting perspective it's up for a

couple of characters or selsun really

can't be dialogue and some mediocre

performances to be generous but it is so

fucking fresh this feels like a brand

new game that if you didn't play the

previous one you would think just was

completely fresh from the top it's a

great game I really like that you could

almost feel the passion who's out of the

offices of the game it felt like they

knew exactly what they wanted to do and

what the original game was about

capturing some good horror elements some

very disturbing scenes some great gore

really impressive work just across the

board I think the level design was

obviously good because you know back

then you had to rely on really well-done

levels in order to make the game less

longer you couldn't just rely on just

making the level and the playing field

super big with thousands of enemies

ham-fisted into it because back then the

hardware couldn't handle that kind of

shit so I like the old-school level

design where everything really

connects and it's filled with a lot of

interesting stuff and some little hidden

things that you may miss or may not if

you're really a completionist I do have

a complaint though I don't think the

puzzles are always that great some of

them I think are well-designed I think

they're fun to tackle but it take for

example Zelda and Zelda the puzzle has

multiple solutions in certain cases in

breadth of the wild and the puzzle

really is here's a challenge now it's up

to you to solve it and Resident Evil -

that's not the case the puzzle is I

don't know here's a fucking locked toy

chest with the key to escape the scary

building but you need to find the toy

hammer which was in the East Wing room

on the north side of the police station

and hidden within a condom that was in

the bottom left of that room right next

to two boxes that were really dimly lit

so it just becomes a scavenger hunt to

find what you need to put in some place

not every puzzle is actually about

figuring out the solution it's about

just exploring and finding what you

needed for it and I don't really care

for that scavenger hunt time type of

puzzle solving I think that's just

tedious for the sake of tedium so but

not all puzzles are like that but a good

bit of them are which is a bit

frustrating now one thing I know a lot

of people have complained about but I

don't necessarily think of it as a bad

thing is the zombies or bullet sponges

that was their solution to making

zombies scary and I don't think zombies

should be a pushover at all like zombies

are the main antagonists that shit

shouldn't just be something you brush by

like oh it's a zombie no big deal you

can't just fart near them and have them

explode they need to be imposing and you

need to not want to fight them but I do

understand them becoming a bit of a

nuisance because they are huge fucking

bullet sponges it's like shooting a

goddamn fucking SWAT truck it's like

shooting an armored vehicle because they

take so many shots to bring down you

never want to actually finish off a

zombie with bullets because even just

the most basic zombie like a zombie Girl

Scout takes an entire gun stores worth

of ammo to bring down you'll be out of

ammo for the next boss battle so instead

what you do is you rely on either

stunning or turning them in the crawlers

my complaint is with the stunning I do

have a complaint there the stunning

mechanic seems super inconsistent

sometimes you'll take out your pistol

pop one in the head you

they'll stun them and then you'll be

able to squeak right by them no problem

even give them a little pat on the ass

tell them good game as you go by there's

no issue there but sometimes it'll take

three or four shots from that same

pistol on the same type of zombie to

make the motherfucker even blink so it's

really it seems very inconsistent with

what it takes to actually stun Azzam be

at least in my experience the more

reliable method is to shoot them in the

kneecap and turn them into crawlers

which then also still takes like two to

four bullets depending on your aim and

depending on the zombie which is a lot

more manageable than the 800 it takes to

actually fucking kill one now I the last

complaint I have about the game is I

don't like the playthroughs after the

initial Leon and Claire playthrough

because then you're just repeating the

same puzzles with such miniscule

differences between them it seems

completely worthless you get a little

bit of extra cannon but that's it it's

it's like two or three different lines

between the playthroughs so you do Leon

a you do Claire B that's how I did it

and you get basically everything there's

only trivial differences and a little

bits of extra cannon and the other

playthroughs it's probably worth just

looking that up instead of doing the

same fucking set of puzzles again

because that's just not fun for me I

didn't enjoy backtracking the exact same

landscape and as Claire that I did as

Leon solving the same puzzles just with

a slightly different solution to the

puzzle being like one different number

that wasn't extremely fun but I did like

Claire's story a bit better than Leon's

so it's worth it for this story to go

through it at least one more time and

then maybe just YouTube the other two

differences but overall it's just a

great game it's extremely fun it feels

great and I really like games like these

that deliver an old-school experience

that tell a fun story it has some cheesy

dialogue that it's shamelessly axe i I

enjoyed everything about it it was

thrilling it did great with the gore the

horror elements and it did keep it

pretty tense when you saw a horde of

zombies you're like fuck how am I gonna

get by this without wasting all of my

ammo you're going through the sewers

fuck it's one of those shit demons

that's gonna poison me do I have blue

herbs to take care of this it's really

just an enjoyable game that I had a lot

of fun doing the fourth Survivor mode

was a nice little cherry on top with the

tofu mode being a beautiful little hand

job it was just a nice little added

bonus a happy ending overall fun game

great experience let's plug this shit

into the moist muta Resident Evil 2

remake is Geetha is getting an

85-percent I can't recommend this enough

and I really hope it sets the president

for upcoming remakes of older properties

because this is the kind of shit I would

love to see classic titles completely

revisited revamp for the modern age

because it just works super well this

game is fucking great and I enjoyed

almost every second of it that's it so

yeah

Moist Meter | Dragon Ball Super: Broly

initiating moisture the new Dragon Ball

super bro Lee movie just dropped in

America let's plug that bitch into the

moist meter so Dragon Ball is a series I

grew up with I fucking loved it I was

watching it before I had any hair on my

nutsack or in my asshole now I'm fucking

covered in it but while I was watching

this movie it made me feel like there

was no hair down there again it made me

feel like a kid on the edge of my

fucking seat come on big muscle man

punch him in his big muscley abs and

then rip it his nipples and and really

milk those milky milk tank pecs of his

really get after it power up and scream

it was so fucking fun I'll go ahead and

admit I'm not kept up with Dragon Ball

super I gave it a try when it first came

out but I didn't enjoy it so I dropped

it but I'll probably start watching it

now cuz this shit was so good so I'm not

familiar with the modern Dragon Ball

lore and I still really fucking enjoyed

this movie I saw all Dragon Ball Dragon

Ball Z and all of Dragon Ball GT for

however useless that shit was and I

still really fucking love this movie I

loved the original Broly movies and I

like what they did with this one they

completely changed his origin well not

completely but they they retcon most of

his origin which is a good thing because

his origin previously was really fucking

goofy like he was just damage because

Goku cried a lot when he was a baby so

then the crying really makes him sad and

mad at the same time it was a fucking

weird goofy origin so I like what they

did here they made Broly a super

interesting character instead of this

weird sociopathic madman who just really

gets mad about Goku crying so I like

that they made the character really cool

he was always cool but they made him

like an actual interesting cool

character not just like a

two-dimensional AB machine

I also liked every other character in

this movie too I really was surprised by

how much I enjoyed the shit that wasn't

fighting I went into this thinking only

the fighting would be fun but really

everything was good even like the little

wholesome moments between the characters

the way they got along and the little

jokes they'd crack it was all just

wholesome and enjoyable and the fights

were fucking spectacular some of the

best I've seen in anime actually I don't

know if Dragon Ball super the show has

this level of quality but if it does

holy shit the fights were apps

spectacular to watch and the second you

thought the fight was winding down

there'd be like just some filler

dialogue like I have big muscles you

have big muscles and I'm gonna scream

about it and we're gonna sit here for

two minutes and just talk it didn't

happen

there to be maybe like a quick exchange

of a sentence or two and then bang right

back to jerk and Dixon two assholes it

was fucking wild it's incredible how

they just kept ramping up the action but

it was so goofily fun I couldn't help

but notice it eventually the fight

between Goku Vegeta and burly took place

on ice and then all of a sudden all the

ice gets destroyed to take place in the

core and the core is getting fucking

destroyed then all of a sudden it's

taking place in like this alternate

dimensional multiverse space-time

continuum tear and then that fucking

explodes so Doc Brown and Marty get

fucked it was weird

like it kept changing but from one

location like they were so powerful they

were literally changing reality around

themselves like fuck the Infinity stones

they were literally punching reality out

of existence it was wild it was so

beautiful to watch and one thing I

always talk about with anime that I

always fucking hate but the all anime

does it is CGI in this movies it's it's

not you know innocent in that regard

there's CGI in here and there's quite a

bit of it during the fights I understand

why because the fight is like fucking 40

minutes of pure high-octane testosterone

going on but you can't help but notice

when that CGI comes on-screen it's

really not as bad as I expected it's not

nearly as bad as every other anime that

uses CGI like a goblin Slayer or

overlord or anything like that it's

pretty decently done and some of it is

even kind of hard to notice which is

admirable

I just really fucking hate CGI and I

have to pay compliments that at least

when they used it it wasn't that bad so

that's good another complaint that I

have is you know in Dragonball one thing

it's famous for is them saying the

attacks like Gallic gun Kamehameha big

come last move oh mighty Omega Lord that

doesn't happen so now when one of them

uses a Gallic gun for example Vegeta

uses the Gallic gun he doesn't say it

for some reason there's like this this

ethereal voice that says Gallic done

it's like part of the soundtrack as if

like one of the musicians while

shredding on the guitar and like double

bass pedaling his drums just says Gallic

gun it was dumb I really didn't fucking

like that at all it felt weird felt

super out of place I don't know why you

wouldn't have the characters do what you

expect them to do because they've done

it for 20 fucking years I don't know why

they changed that here I don't know if

it's like that in the show but in the

movie I didn't like that at all

that made me very sad because I was

looking forward to you know a grand

command mayor from Goku you know that

shit is iconic but instead you get the

the name being said by the leader of the

the marching band in the background so

that's a it's a nitpick it's a complaint

but it's not a big deal especially when

everything else around the movie and the

fight was good it's just something that

you'll immediately take notice of and be

like well that's kind of fucking sad but

otherwise this movie is just gonna be

purely pumping blood to your penis while

watching especially if you're a fan of

the show let's go ahead and plug this

shit into the moist meter

I'm giving Dragon Ball super bro Lee an

85-percent it is a great action

animation I wouldn't go in there

expecting some kind of tail that's going

to be a profound statement or gonna be

like a really thought-provoking piece

it's Dragon Ball you don't get that shit

you get muscles explosions and

testosterone and you get that in excess

here it's fucking great and I really

enjoyed it start to finish I think if

you like Dragon Ball I think absolutely

gonna love this one but even if you're

not a fan of this series I do think

there still is a lot to like here if you

can appreciate good old-fashioned

animation so yeah that's it

Moist Meter | Glass

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're looking at glass and

before we start this I'd like to talk

about forgiveness because I think it's

very important to this movie forgiveness

is something that it's often hard to do

in my case here going into this movie I

had to forgive one particular sinner and

that is the director M night on

your childhood he committed a very

high-level sin by absolutely butchering

the Avatar movie to an insulting level

literally dropping his trousers and

taking a fat wet fart and

pumping it into the mouths of everyone

that liked avatar it was a disservice

what he did to all of humanity with that

movie and I still have not completely

forgiven him I love to split I thought

that was a fantastic movie but it wasn't

enough to earn my forgiveness so going

into glass I had to come in here ready

to forgive and I feel like I did I mean

I like them Rekha below I like split so

I was very excited to see how this whole

thing wraps up and it's well I don't

think anyone's gonna be completely

satisfied with the movie there's a lot

that it does well and a lot of a lot of

stinky about it I'm gonna get to

the stinkiest right now the ending

the last I'll say like 35 minutes of

this movie are absolutely abominable so

as you know this is the conclusion to

his trilogy his superhero trilogy it is

a superhero trilogy I put it like this

because it's not what you'd expect for

superheroes you don't have like muscles

and superpowers and you know a big big

 fist to the face and shattered

bones all over the place or anything

it's a very psychologically made a

character piece superhero trilogy and

it's really really well done at least up

until glass it was and in this movie the

last 35 ish minutes completely forget

that it's not supposed to be like a

standard superhero movie it dives into

showing off like these are super human

men look at them doing super but

it's not good it's not impressive

basically to show off some super

they do things that you could see on a

YouTube video right now in the real

world like a guy

bending something heavy oh wow and like

the ultimate plot the ultimate

conclusion is extremely underwhelming

and I'm not gonna spoil anything but the

ending is really dumb it's

really not well done

but up until the ending there's so much

to like about this movie the opening

with David Dunn I thought was really

great it showed David Dunn what he's

been doing for the last 19 years since

unbreakable and it felt right for the

character he was an enjoyable character

to watch and Bruce Willis

I didn't think gave a great performance

or anything but it almost looked like he

tried again which we haven't seen in a

 decade

that's rarer than a sasquatch sighting

seeing Bruce Willis put effort into a

 movies and these days but he did

seem to give it an attempt and I like

that and I really like the entire arc

well it's not really a narky had but I

really liked the entire story short

story he had at the beginning to set up

the movie James McAvoy's character is

absolutely outstanding an incredible

character across the board he plays a

myriad of different characters they're

all convincing all really great not all

of them super fleshed out but they're

not all supposed to be some of them are

supposed to be just like wild

like holy what the is that

personality doing within this man and

then Samuel Jackson's character glass is

probably one of my favorite villains I

think he is just an incredible villain

and in this movie he's actually pretty

good until the end they they him in

the ass he was so good up until

the end most characters were all of them

just really kind of got by the

you know the old M night at the end no

to just sum up the plot since it's gonna

be important to talk about that in this

section that I'd like to talk about in

the moist meter in a nutshell there are

three superhumans

well almost superhumans no one's

entirely convinced and no one really

knows about their existence that their

actual superhumans or anything and they

all get brought to a psych ward where

the lead doctor is trying to see if

they're actually superhumans or just

delusional she believes they're

delusional and it really is super well

done I enjoyed everything in the psych

ward because they used really clever

ways of making the audience even

question if they're actually superhumans

do they actually possess these powers

are they what you think they are and I

really enjoyed that whole art and if the

characters did a great job of you know

trying not to believe it believing it

maybe it was really it's really great

how they toyed with that but there's a

lot of plot holes that happen throughout

this whole thing and the biggest one

that I didn't think about at the time

but I saw some people mentioning and I

was like holy that's a really great

point is this entire psych ward has the

worst security in the world it's

like they're guarding a blockbuster that

back when blockbuster was popular you

know it actually no it's like they're

but they're guarding a modern

blockbuster no one's gonna go

there except to shoot up heroin so it's

not gonna have great security then they

don't put much emphasis on the security

here which I guess can make sense since

they're not entirely convinced that

their actual superhumans are anything so

why do they need all the security but

even still it's laughable

all of these these people each of their

cells is has like no guards and there is

a guard like one guard stationed every

night and they just leave

sometimes for 40 minutes just to go talk

or you know smoke a cig outside or talk

to the janitor and these people just

completely left unattended to free to do

whatever they'd like and they have in

their rooms they have like glass objects

and that pictures they have tables

they have all kinds of things that you

wouldn't expect a prisoner in a psych

ward to have because it's dangerous now

the biggest thing the biggest plot hole

is James McAvoy's character is held at

bay with lights they installed lights

that would flash anytime he had a

dangerous personality take the stage and

it would make him switch to a safer one

which is a really clever mechanic I

thought that was a really good way of

keeping the guy in there and not letting

him roam free and break out and go crazy

and but the thing is since they're

equipped in these rooms with so much

 at their disposal that they really

shouldn't have all he had to do was

cover his eyes so he didn't see the

flash he could have used

anything he could have used his

hands to cover his eyes but for some

reason any time he tried to escape he

was just looking at it like super

 wide-eyed like a deer in the

headlights and then obviously changing

personalities as a result so he couldn't

get out but all he had to do was cover

his eyes and just walk out because

there's a no guards and be they have so

much there's a lot of plot holes

but

the biggest one that I thought was

definitely worth mentioning I hope that

doesn't get into spoiler territory or

anything I don't think it's a spoiler

since it's not overly important that

there's lights in there but really that

entire arc of the psych ward I thought

was well done excusing the plot holes

and the movie just really loses itself

towards the end

another thing that's worth mentioning

this movie has almost no soundtrack

which is odd because the first two

movies had a really nice score there's

almost nothing here occasionally there's

something that sounds kind of nice but

that's very seldomly used not a huge

complaint again but something worth

mentioning overall I couldn't help but

be disappointed by this and it's

probably just because the third act was

as bad as it is because I really did

enjoy everything leading up to it so

let's go ahead and plug this into

the moist meter I'm giving glass a 60%

and it was hard to settle on a score

because the last act is extremely stinky

but there is a lot to like and I think a

lot of the characters are really well

done as well as a lot of the build-up

but there's no payoff and there's a lot

of really lazy cop-out that's just

hard to believe that that's how it ends

but anyway that's a so yeah gloss honey

both one word but so much difference

between the two

for example glass may have been a

horribly disappointing tool of the M

night Shyamalan Empire honey

Moist Meter | Replicas

initiating moisture I absolutely love

Keanu Reaves I absolutely cannot believe

how fucking awful Keanu Reeves new movie

is it's called replicas and it's a

stinker and a half we already have a

contender for the worst movie of 2019

this shit is some dog shit but it's an

enjoyable pile of dog shit

welcome to the moist meter let's look at

this bitch I'm gonna get into spoilers

because I don't think there's a single

human being out there that just fucking

signed off the internet to avoid

potential spoilers no one's really going

into this wanting to be like shocked out

of their asshole with some crazy

developments or anything like that so I

would need to talk about spoilers to

express how goofy and fun this movie is

this story revolves around a mad

scientist played by Keanu Reeves he's

experimenting with transferring

consciousness from dead people to

robotics giving them a second life

unfortunately his family dies in a car

accident and then he brings them back by

taking their consciousness and

transferring it into some clones that he

grows he grows in his garage that's the

premise and then he in this ends up

getting hunted by his company and shit

and it's absolutely wild they throw

around some really pseudoscience he shit

in the beginning

for instance they have really low budget

props so he basically puts on some type

of out-of-the-box Toys R Us toy on his

head he swipes his hand across it and

then he's a you know doing all these

wild calculations he holds a Rubik's

Cube in the the digital verse the

cyberspace and he's like II D

synthesized me and adds like synthesis

photosynthesis confirmed engaging ultra

mode Ultra mode confirmed Ultra mode

confirmed dead like that's the level of

dialogue you get between the characters

here they do throw around actual science

terms and biological terms and shit such

as neurons they get that one right

sometimes but overall the dialogue is

just so fucking wacky I can't express

how great it is it is probably the worst

dialogue I've heard in a movie honestly

it's up there the

thing is abominable even Keanu doesn't

do a good job with his character

Middleditch almost does a decent job

with his character but everyone is bad

especially the wife the wife is like

right out of 2007 YouTube heiress skit

there is no effort at all from the wife

I'm not sure who plays the wife I didn't

I didn't even look it up but there was

it must be someone from Fiverr there was

nothing it was not an inspired

performance at all you know she gets

brought back from the dead and her

reaction is I'm going upstairs when she

finds out that she was reanimated

because I was supposed to be a secret

and then he tells me she her reaction is

I'm going upstairs and I may be

disappointed about this but you'll never

know because I'm not really giving any

emotion to anything in this movie it's

fucking wild absolutely fucking wild and

for some reason every single time she

talks she ends every word with a period

she sounds like a robot throughout the

entire movie even though she wasn't

supposed to be for instance she'll be

like hello William

good morning William I shit this morning

it's just such a jarring performance I

don't know what the fuck she was going

for there channeling her her inner

Android from the 1970s style movies I

truly don't understand it and then also

for some reason that CGI gets really

shitty I don't know why they bothered

with CGI they have like this really

awful CGI robot at the end of the movie

that goes on like this action figure

type tirade like with movements I'm

saying like the character moves like a

fucking action figure would like really

stiff and my frame-by-frame it's almost

as if it was a flipbook that they

somehow transposed onto the movie the

CGI is awful it it's I wish that was

never even there but I'm glad it was

because that shit made me giggle quite

hard

unfortunately this movie had a good

concept I like from a conceptual level

that where his family is replicas they

don't know it and it's about you know

bringing his family back and playing God

toying with memories and shit I like

that from a conceptual standpoint but

it's executed so so poorly so laughably

bad it's amazing the amount of plot

holes you could poke into this bitch is

crazy

there's also a lot of plot points that

come out of nowhere

like when his company becomes evil they

were evil because they wanted to

transfer the mind of an elite pilot into

every drone so they needed his research

on transferring consciousness to

synthetics to make that a reality even

gives the example of imagine a virus

that has the mind of the hacker in it

like that's inefficient it seems like

you don't understand technology the best

pilot in the world would be worse than

one of the worst drones in the world

that's kind of the idea of the

technology technology can go way above

humans so why would you want to take it

back by putting a pilot's mind in there

then all of a sudden you got your drone

thinking about porn and titties and shit

while it's flying around or or the the

virus why would you want the mind of an

insell hacker embedded in your virus

where it gets distracted with a crypto

currency investments or something and it

just stops doing its job I don't

understand why that would seemed like a

good idea from a plot standpoint but

again I'm glad it was there because it

really is an enjoyable II awful movie

and it is an awful movie make no mistake

and I'm really sad that it is cuz that

like I said I love Keanu and I do think

from a conceptual standpoint this movie

had a good idea but man nothing in this

movie worked not a single goddamn thing

so let's plug this shit into the moist

meter

I'm giving replicas a 10% and I hurts me

to say that because I am such a huge fan

of Keanu if you're watching Keanu it is

nothing personal I fucking love you man

I really do but shit like at some point

in the development of this movie someone

had to be like wow guys what the fuck

are we doing we're Frankenstein and this

is our monster fuck it get it out there

anyway

like this is bad it's bad objectively

not good but yeah it's probably worth

seeing for like I so bad it's good type

movie that's it so yeah

The 5 Best Movies of 2018

initiating moisture welcome ladies and

gentlemen to the moist ease yet again

last week the sacred moist council gave

out the awards for the top 5 biggest

stinkers of the movie industry of 2018

today we're looking at the top 5 biggest

thinkers because they're gonna make your

Winky Dink or bigger at their good

movies we're looking at the five best

movies of 2018 so let's start this shit

off number five upgrade upgrade is an

incredibly unique movie to see in 2018

modern cinema it's a lower budget movie

which you just don't fucking get anymore

because now it's go big or go super

flaccid where they only spend their

money on the same same fucking IPS same

type of movies the most by-the-numbers

generic shit in the world so you don't

see shit like upgrade that often and

when you do it's usually pretty stinky

pretty fucking bad but upgrade is in a

fantastic movie start to finish great

characters a fucking amazing universe

with all these body augmentations that

lead to some really cool fights but

don't shy away from showing you the

blood gore and come flying all over the

place when they really get into a huge

scuffle it's a really good movie and the

story isn't bad either the story is

pretty cool it's a nice revenge story

it's like a cyber John wick like an

Augmented John wick but it's not like

actually John wick doing any of the

killing it's like a robot in John wick

what I'm saying is it's a fucking great

revenge movie and it's so fucking fun to

watch unfold moving on to number four

annihilation annihilation is a movie

that is hard to put into words it's a

really abstract movie that is so great

and it works so well there are some

characters that I think we're pretty

shitty but they don't hold the movie

back the movie is just so much more than

the characters and so much more than

just what you see on screen it's a movie

that you think about afterwards and like

fuck that was really impressive and the

movie is so nice to look at and so

goddamn incredible to listen to

like I said in the moist meter I made

for this the final the final song on the

soundtrack here the final score of the

movie and the last scene which goes on

for like 10 minutes is perhaps the best

single piece of music I've ever heard in

a movie it is absolutely amazing and the

scene that complements it is really

profound and I really just love

everything about annihilation and it's

there is some horror elements to it I

think they have perhaps one of the most

effective horror monster creatures in

the movie with the mutated bear that can

mimic the sound of screams it's really

good everything about this movie is

really fucking well done and it's not

afraid to disturb you sometimes and make

you think and it's got a good good cast

of characters for the most part with

some really fucking cool shit going on

annihilation is a movie I'd never seen

anything like before and I haven't seen

any saying anything like it since

fucking fantastic easily deserving in

the number-4 spot but number three is

going to be going to Deadpool two and

now I'm not some huge Deadpool fan who

goes around cosplaying and they're

talking about wieners at the comic-con

or anything like that and also I know

this movie has a whole bunch of fucking

flaws so if some of you probably think

this spot was bought and paid for by

Ryan Reynolds I fucking wish it was Ryan

Reynolds if you're watching this shit

man yeah feel free to reach out if you

want to talk about moist ease your

fucking anything really man Ida Jack you

late into my pants if I even walked

through the air that he crop-dusted with

one of his farts I have a fucking love

Ryan Reynolds and this movie's just so

good that I can overlook all the flaws

it's such a good comedy I honestly think

it's probably the best comedy I've ever

seen in a movie theater

every single joke for the most part

landed in the second half I think the

first half was kind of weak but in the

second half the movie just had the

entire theater roaring myself included

which doesn't happen

I don't like comedy movies overall I

would say they're probably some of the

worst that get made but this movie was

more than just a comedy movie this movie

was a profound there was a good comedy

movie it was just so fucking good it was

really enjoyable really clever jokes

really good bits

this whole fucking movie was just an

enjoyable experience to have and I think

most people can appreciate the comedy in

this movie it has

different types of comedic styles for

different tastes overall it's not just

like the lul xD random here's the fuck

knuckles or anything like that it does a

great job at making people laugh

in a big way and I think that definitely

speaks to a good movie a really good

movie moving on to number two goes to

searching which is the movie that I was

so close to giving a hundred percent to

on the moist meter because it is

genuinely the best thriller mystery

movie I've ever seen and I think it is

the best thriller mystery movie that

even exists in that genre searching is a

movie that I cannot praise enough it's a

movie that uses a gimmick we've seen

before and unfriended where it all takes

place on a computer screen but it uses

it so incredibly well that it just adds

so much to the movie overall or it

really feels like you're just peeking in

the fucking window like you're looking

for titties and into a man's life as

he's trying to get his daughter back and

you're trying to figure out what

happened to the daughter and there's so

many different clues and so many

different paths that lead to a dead end

in terms of what happened it's just such

a good movie that's so well executed

with incredible acting and an impressive

narrative to tell that really covers

pretty much every plot hole you could

ever poke into it I could hardly think

of anything they didn't wrap up and

resolve and explain it's just such an

incredible fucking movie that it's just

it's so goddamn good I can't I can't

stress enough how good of a movie

searching is nor how well done it is and

now we're moving on to 2018 s best movie

of the year and this may not come as a

surprise to many people considering how

I talked about this one but this one

goes to spider-man into the spider verse

2 superhero movies on the top-five list

I swear to god I'm not some like diehard

comic book only like superhero could

only get hard for superhero content kind

of guy but this last year just had so

many good superhero flicks into the

spider-verse is the best animation I

have ever seen there is not a second

that goes by in this movie where your

eyes aren't orgasming at what you're

seeing on screen everything loses style

about this movie every single action no

matter how

trivial is so fucking beautiful to watch

in that universe there's some super

trippy moments some really impressive

fights a very touching narrative some

great characters great acting the music

is top-notch it really comes across as a

beautiful passion project where everyone

on the team was on the same page went to

work every day with the big smile on

their face coming their pants ready to

work and make the best project they

could possibly make and it comes across

that way and it really feels like they

made the best possible animation they

could for spider-man it is an amazing

movie absolutely fantastic and I can't

recommend into the spider-verse

enough absolutely amazing movie that I

really think is deserving of the top

spot on the prestigious moist ease so

thank you everyone for tuning in stay

wet and fuck ya looking forward to 2019

best movies and shitty movies all the

shit fuck ya see everyone

Moist Meter | Escape Room

initiating moisture put that dick away

now I'm just kidding take that dick back

out its the moist meter today we're

looking at a scape room a movie that

delivers exactly we'd expect based upon

the trailers it delivers goofy b-movie

mediocrity it's a movie that's very

clearly inspired by the cube and also

even takes a couple condoms out of the

top drawer of the sauce series

it's a mashup of the two but it's not

done super well but there are some good

scenes and at some points it does get

clever but overall it just doesn't

succeed where it wanted to and it has

such a shitty ending it's it's so

different from what the entire movie

leads you up to believe is gonna happen

at the end it's as if it's an episode of

Kim Possible to finish this shit off it

ends exactly like unfriended to the dark

web it makes no sense for the movie and

it's there to like set up a franchise or

something that I don't think it's gonna

happen

it's gonna fucking flop harder than

universe's universals dark series or

what the fuck they called out the dark

universe or some dumb shit it was

unnecessary and it completely took away

from everything else not that everything

else leading up to it was super great to

begin with but it sucked the little bit

of moisture out of all of that even now

I do like the premise of this movie

about six strangers getting mysterious

invitations to compete in a $10,000

escape room turns out the escape rooms

sinister starts killing them and they

have to win to survive I think that

premise can lead to a lot of memorable

scenes memorable rooms and puzzles but

it doesn't in this movie there's almost

nothing memorable about this movie it's

a movie you'll walk away and forget half

the shit that happen in there and half

the characters the characters are pretty

awful all the characters are cliche

forgettable and not well done they're

not well written characters but there is

one good room in this movie and that's a

room where it's like a fucking biker bar

there's a pool table on the ceiling and

the characters are on the floor which is

also the ceiling so it's this distorted

room and the camerawork plays with your

perception of it and it's really well

done that entire scene I thought was

great

including the puzzle but none of the

other ones are that good except for

perhaps the room where

there's a psychedelic scene where the

whole room and camera work and

characters start melting and it really

does make you feel disoriented I also

thought that was pretty well done the

movie I want to say is not bad it's not

like a fucking train wreck or a diarrhea

explosion on the screen it really is not

bad the ending is horrendous I'm gonna

just throw away the ending when I say

the movie's not bad because that is it's

truly just a huge disappointment and

completely useless but everything before

that really isn't horrible now I do

think all the characters were shit

I think they're all super cliche but it

is still fun to watch them participate

in the escape room and work well

together to solve the puzzles even

though a lot of shit happens that makes

no sense if you just excuse all that you

can have a lot of fun I'm plugging this

shit into the moist meter I'm giving

escape room a 45 percent it's almost a

completely average movie at that nice 50

percent mark but man that ending knocks

it off of that it could have been a 50

percent you almost had it but holy shit

who ever wrote that ending really fucked

you on that one that your report cards

not looking good from the moist meter

there because of that it is probably

worth watching drunker with friends or

something like that or if you like

escape rooms perhaps but it's not an

amazing movie

it's the cube but for teenagers who

don't like gore or to think real hard

and that's about it so yeah

The 5 Worst Movies of 2018

initiating moisture you may not have

invited me to your La Crosse house party

to do keg stands with the boys and but

chug natty light with the bros but i

hope you kept your door unlocked cuz I'm

coming in anyway with the moist ease

baby that's fuckin right today we're

looking at the top five worst movies of

2018 I'll just go ahead and kick this

shit right off number five Pacific Rim -

this movie was the most disappointing

movie I've seen this year since I really

liked the first Pacific Rim this one

took the stinkiest shit on top of it

that I could ever imagine I honestly

would have been less disappointed if

they had just turned the sequel the

Pacific Rim into a porno or even like

Pacific Rim go or some shit anything

that wasn't what we got with Pacific Rim

- it is truly a pourraient it completely

changes what Pacific Rim was about which

is just about you know rock and roll

titties mech action kaiju fight and shit

you know spitting blood spittin titties

out and everything and it turned it into

like a goddamn summer camp for kids

which also sometimes has robots fighting

shit underwhelming horribly executed

none of the characters were likable or

good all of the action was bad

occasionally there was some decent

things to look at but when it was

sprinkled with all these little diarrhea

flakes that were on it that just makes

it unpalatable really bad movie

extremely disappointing

just don't make a Pacific Rim 3 I'd hate

to see it turned into like a musical on

ice that has like a Gundam in the middle

of it or something it's just an insult

what they've done the Pacific Rim moving

on to number 4 I feel pretty

this one's on here because oh it's Amy

Schumer do I really need to justify it

more do I even need to say more it's an

Amy Schumer movie but it's the worst Amy

Schumer movie I've seen quite a few I

even suffered through her stand-up just

to kind of get a taste for what the fuck

goes on there it's it's as bad as you'd

expect both in the stand-up and this

movie it's horrible it's a movie that's

supposed to celebrate like being

comfortable in your own skin but it

makes being fat and everything like the

enemy it makes people feel bad about

their body there's nothing positive

about this movie it's a horrible movie

with awful jokes that there's not a

whole ton of Mullah China's in the movie

because it's pg-13 so she can't say

vagina my pussy pussy smells like

barnyard animal and cow manure my pussy

takes the dick pussy's you know she

can't say her normal stand-up shit in

the movie so that's good but it's still

a really bad movie overall even the most

die-hard Amy Schumer fans were able to

muster enough brainpower out there to

form an opinion of the movie and their

opinion of it was negative which is very

rare because they'll pretty much defend

Amy Schumer to the grave it's wild and

even they didn't like this movie

obviously I can understand why it's

super fucking bad moving on to number

three Winchester I personally think

putting horror movies in the top five

worst lists is cheating but god damn it

- they really fucking deserve it the

horror movies these days are always so

bad they're just so fucking bad

Winchester's no exception it's really

bad I'm gonna spoil the conclusion I'm

sure none of you give a shit he shoots

the ghost to kill it and win the day and

the whole thing about it it's just all

bad man the sets cool I like the set of

the Winchester mansion that's the only

compliment I could ever give this movie

still a compliment anyone could ever

give this movie nothing scary about it

nothing at all it's not scary it's not

enjoyable it's not so bad it's good it

just fucking insults the viewers

intelligence to even be sitting there

knowing you wasted money watching it and

wasted time horrible fucking movie even

for horror movie standards moving on to

number two

truth or dare what do you fucking know

it's another horror movie you're gonna

notice a little pattern yeah truth or

dare is even worse than Winchester truth

or dare

has a horrible concept you know a truth

or dare game where you got to do the

dares or you've got to tell the truth

and it takes it to a level that you

would never think human beings were

capable of reaching you didn't think

anyone could be that fucking stupid when

writing a script or a story every

character makes the stupidest little

snapchat filter smiley face thing that

was their gimmick then they asked a

truth or dare question none of the dares

are the truths are scary or interesting

or well thought out

it's just so poorly written every

character fucking sucks asshole and I'm

just gonna give you a little sneak

preview here I'm gonna spoil the ending

again here they confront the demon of

truth or dare the truth or dare evil

demon Lord of Christmas as they're

directly confronting them they get asked

a truth or dare question the last one of

the movie all they had to do was put

something in a jar that there were two

seconds away from doing the demon

asagaya truth or dare question and

instead of just picking truth which is

just harmless you just tell the truth

about something

he chose dare and the Dare was to kill

the guy that was about to save the day

hey I mean like what the fuck were you

thinking his reasoning for not choosing

truth and saving the world was because

he didn't want anyone to have to do a

dare what a fucking hero what a martyr

I'm sure everyone's gonna really like

that decision in that universe super

fucking bad movie awful all around

moving on to number one and a surprise

to no one the worst movie of this year

is also a horror movie and I'm sure most

of you can already guess what movie gets

it

it's Slenderman Slenderman is a truly

abominable trainwreck of cinema a movie

that is seven years passed when its

character was popular when Slenderman

was popular was 2011 this movie came out

in 2018 nobody gives a fuck about

Slenderman any more memes die by the

hour

moth meme died in 30 seconds every meme

is so fucking short-lived in 2018 no

one's gonna give a shit about a

seven-year old one and especially when

the movies as bad as this is it's an

absolute train wreck edited poorly

thrown together awfully the story makes

no sense slender man's not even the bad

guy trees or the bad guy they make

nature the evil force in the movie not

even Slenderman he's just kind of there

he's probably fucking afraid of the

trees to every character sucks asshole

none of the characters make smart

decisions it's so fucking bad I'd rather

play every goddamn Slenderman game

back-to-back-to-back-to-back

instead of watch this movie for a second

time it is that fucking bad it is not

even so bad it's enjoyable it's so bad

it's frustrating to watch and sit

through and it fucking hurts to sit

there it burns your goddamn eyes a

horrible movie absolutely deserving of

the number one spot in this year's moist

East top 5 worst movies of the year we

had a lot of really shitty stinkers in

horror-movie department that's for

goddamn sure but I do believe this

top-five list is backed up by scientific

data that can 100% prove these are by

far the five worst of the year thank you

for tuning in to the moist ease so yeah

The Worst 5 Games of 2018

initiating moisture today we're gonna be

taking a look at the worst games of 2018

the shittiest stinkers of the video game

industry this year 2018 years after the

death of Christ these five games have

spit on his legacy so I hope you're

wearing a condom because we're coming in

hot

it's the moist these bitch number five

crisis on the Planet of the Apes VR I

know it's cheating to put VR games on

the top five worst list because pretty

much every VR games pretty fucking

stinky my HTC vive is basically just a

beat saber machine that's about the only

game worth playing VR for but still this

game takes it to the next level

this game is vomit-inducing it is

nauseating when I played crisis on the

Planet of the Apes VR I thought I was

gonna have to check myself into a

hospital I thought I got like food

poisoning or something I thought someone

fucking flooded my room with a

neurotoxin I was getting dizzy

incredibly ill and on the verge of

puking it was miserable experience I

couldn't stand more than 30 minutes tops

of that game and it's not like there's a

whole lot of fun to be had even if you

couldn't muscle through the nausea there

was just not anything fun there at all I

don't think anyone expected anything

great from a movie tie-in VR game that's

the that's a recipe for disaster

it'd be like being surprised that go

urine taste bad what were you expecting

you get what you expect and then some

with crisis on the Planet of the Apes

because it truly is absolutely

disgusting to play it fucking hurts to

play moving on to number 4 radical

Heights Cliff Bleszinski really had his

work cut out for him to make an even

worse game than lawbreakers to make a

game that was such a hard fucking flop a

biblical flop was almost unheard of with

lawbreakers and yet the madman the

genius the lunatic the mad scientist of

the gaming industry the bad boy of video

gaming comes back and says you know what

I can make a bigger flop and bang

radical heights is born right from mr.

blows in skis butthole and man was it

fucking atrocious

a blatant cash grab to really capitalize

on the hysteria surrounding the Battle

Royale genre a game that was thrown

together in no more than two weeks with

almost no textures in the game half the

buildings had no textures nothing was

functional for the most part everything

was stock assets and they had the

audacity to implement a microtransaction

system before working on anything else

a truly bold move that wasn't rewarded

because it led to Cliff Bleszinski

having to close down his game studio

which disappointed almost two people in

the world I'm sure but radical Heights

was a game born from his asshole and it

really did smell like shit there was

almost nothing to like about the game it

did nothing unique it did nothing new

and it did nothing well a game that I'm

sure nobody looks back on and misses

number three hunt down the Freeman a

game that is by far steams most broken

stinker of the year you couldn't beat

the game unless you use the command

console and noclip some shit and the

story was absolutely incomprehensible

that brought along a lot of YouTube

talent to voice act for it and I can't

stress enough how fucking dumb the story

was it made JK Rowling's retconning of

her Harry Potter lore makes sense in

comparison it was an extremely ambitious

project that delivered on absolutely

nothing and devolved into a series of

tedious and frustrating levels where you

were just going up against a horde of

mindlessly broken AI I gave you

absolutely nothing to do other than roll

your eyes cry and shit your pants it's a

game that was an absolute failure in all

possible areas and a huge embarrassment

for a lot of the youtubers that acted in

the game hunt down the Freeman is the

video game equivalent of the room but

without any of the charm and so bad it's

fun this game is just so bad it's

hurtful

number two gene rain gene rain right now

holds the record on the moist meter for

the lowest score ever given out with a

2% and it absolutely earns every percent

of that - right there it is

fucking abysmal sometimes in a so bad

it's good way but most of the time in us

so bad I want to call my mom and sob

over the phone why there is nothing in

this game that works I really don't know

how any studio filled

with actual human beings could think

that this game was ready to ship or was

ever even a good idea on paper I just

have a hard time believing actual

red-blooded human being sat down and

even made this I feel like this was just

an AI generated game from an AI in 1980

you know if you asked a supercomputer in

the 80s on a WordPad what they thought a

video game in 2018 would look and feel

like this would be the result that it

would spit out

it is so bafflingly bad I've already

covered thoroughly why this game is as

bad as it is in the moist meter I made

for it so if you want a more detailed

analysis you can check that out but for

now to keep it concise to really just

sum up why this game deserves the

number-two spot in a nutshell it's

because it's shit it's extremely shitty

moving on to number one the worst game

of 2018 the culling - a video game that

redefined what it meant to be a failure

this game launched and was dead within

19 hours and it was the follow-up to a

pretty successful first game the culling

so the culling twos collapse was

unprecedented there was no one that

could have predicted that this game

would flop nearly as hard as it did it

made lawbreakers look like an

overwhelming success in the game's

19-hour lifespan I think there was only

about 50 total games that were played it

was once again a battle royale that was

just capitalizing on that market as

quickly as it could but it didn't work

at all because at no point did more than

a hundred people buy the game it's Mac's

player account with something like 94

that only kept going down and down and

down as the minutes went on in fact

within 19 hours you couldn't find a game

so for the last 5 hours of its lifespan

on Steam you genuinely couldn't play it

you were just throwing your money away

you might as well just wiped your

asshole with it and flushed it down the

toilet instead of buy this game you

would have accomplished the same effect

you got a game you couldn't play because

there wasn't players to even play it and

I mean that literally sometimes you'll

hear that with overwatch or some other

game that's dying where like all there's

just not enough players to play it's not

worth even hopping on but in the culling

- you literally could not start a match

because there was a minimum number

players required to get one going that

it could never ever meet because nobody

bought the dogshit if you were one of

the unfortunate eight or nine souls that

did buy the game while it was on Steam

you've already been refunded for it in

full the game was taken off steam very

very quickly because it was such an

incredible failure the studio came out

and apologized for it which is nice they

recognized what they did was super

scummy and shitty and I like that they

reimbursed the poor consumers that did

fall for it and buy it but man oh man

the culling too has earned this spot

like a motherfucker easily the worst

game of 2018 and perhaps one of the

worst of all time because its launch was

so incredibly bad and you genuinely

couldn't play it there's a lot of bad

games out there but at least they can be

played the calling to the most you could

do is just hold your dick around in the

purgatory waiting room of the of the

lobby that was all you could do in the

game it's it was an incredible one it

definitely earns the top spot thank you

for tuning in to the first moisty Awards

these were the top 5 worst games of 2018

fuck ya see ya

special stinker alert special stinker

alert

we will not be including fallout 76 in

the top 5 worst games because neither of

us played it because we're not fucking

idiots who bought the game but it is

absolutely deserving of a special

stinker award because the game is

absolutely abominable everything that

has happened with its launch the way

it's been handled the way Bethesda's

handled things by refunding players 500

in-game currency for a completely broken

shit stain they released is nothing shy

of a slap to the face of elite gaming

specimen everywhere the game is

completely empty so many glitches it's

laughable

even for Bethesda standards the bugs are

unforgivable and the way they handle it

is just downright evil they mislead

consumers with their special edition

canvas bags that never really existed

the game hardly works at all even when

it's not riddled with its bugs it is

just a truly miserable experience to

watch to read about and I'm sure to play

but I will not be playing it Jackson has

not played it but it is definitely

deserving of this special stinker

so Bethesda take a bow you have now

become one of the most hated video game

companies all of your goodwill has

hopefully been burnt to the ground

Moist Meter | Bandersnatch

initiating moisture what's fuckin black

mirror fans welcome to the moist meter

and today we're looking at Bandersnatch

everyone's talking about this movie so I

made sure to check this shit out and I

absolutely don't regret it I'm not a big

black mirror fan it was never my cup of

cum

but I definitely was kind of excited to

see this one after all the praise it's

been getting and goddamn does it live up

to the hype I really fucking enjoyed

Bandersnatch super different from

anything I've ever seen before it's not

like an entirely unique concept there's

games that have done it as well as some

shorts that have also done the whole

interactive movie that changes with your

decisions

it's like telltale games done right in a

movie format it is super fucking fun and

I thought it was gonna be just kind of

gimmicky I thought it was gonna be you

make these choices and in the end it

really just doesn't matter and to a

certain extent that's accurate the whole

thing preaches the illusion of choice

and how you're never really in control I

appreciate that theme and I think it

plays it beautifully now if you're like

me an elite ultra turbo gamer you've

been hurt by bad story changing decision

games like Mass Effect where your

decisions don't matter you know you make

all these choices throughout the course

of three games and in the end the only

difference it makes is the color Sox

Commander Shepard is wearing in the

final cutscene so I know you've probably

been hurt by that like I have but this

one does it so well and the choices you

make give you an entirely different

viewing experience and there's nice

little Easter eggs that I'm sure haven't

even all been discovered yet it's just

it's fucking fantastic how well they've

done this the entire narrative the story

weaves into the choice making the whole

act of choosing your own adventure is

woven into the narrative beautifully and

becomes an integral part of the

experience all the characters are so

well done there's no bad characters in

the entire movie fuck I just really

enjoyed this there's almost nothing I

can shit on here except for a couple of

the choice play outs are kind of goofy

sometimes you'll choose something and

what you get is extremely silly like

you'll choose drink your coffee

instead what he does is he bust the

fucking coffee mug in his hand and then

throw shards of glass at his father or

something sometimes you don't understand

what's gonna happen when you make that

choice which I guess plays into the

you're not really in control which is

cool and the whole fucking movie is just

really good I really enjoyed the

everything about it honestly fuck it's

hard for me to just start talking about

this without spoiling anything I think

it's gonna be very difficult for anyone

to really properly review it completely

spoiler free but I'm gonna do my best

and just let you know this shit does

decision-making narrative expertly the

few complaints I do have though are it

kind of starts off a bit slow it seems

like the decisions you're gonna be

making are trivial ones that don't

matter and there's also a lot of

hand-holding in the beginning for

example you'll make a choice and the

game will immediately end and tell the

movie will end and tell you to go back

and make the other choice I didn't quite

like that where it'll tell you you need

to make another choice and force you to

which I guess really isn't that big of a

deal because you're probably gonna go

back and make the other choice anyway

unless you're fuckin speedrunning

Bandersnatch really the I don't think

the interactivity of this movie will be

something that changes the game or

anything I feel like it really only

works with this because the whole story

was created around it and the actual

viewer interaction of the movie is

played into the narrative of it it calls

attention to it and you become a

participant in this story

in fact you become pretty much the

villain of the story the puppet master

which is fantastic they've done a great

job with that and I don't really

understand a lot of the complaints

saying that it's overly gimmicky and it

offers nothing because this offers a lot

more than most you know start to finish

movies which is every fucking movie I

don't know I'm putting that in a

category this offers almost what a video

game does which is extra hours of

entertainment on top of what you've

already experienced and that's gotta

count for something I really enjoyed

watching Bandersnatch and playing

through multiple different endings it

was a lot of fucking fun although some

endings were better than others and some

were just kind of dog shit to be honest

it was super fucking enjoyable very

unique and a great experience I'd

recommend plugging this shit into the

moist meat

giving Bandersnatch a 90 actually very

fucking good and I didn't expect it to

be as good as it was so fuck yeah good

shit see ya

Moist Meter | Goblin Slayer

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter get out your waifu body pillows

and flashlights because today we're

going asshole deep into another anime

we're looking at goblin slayer goblin

Slayers a show that I thought got off to

a fantastic fucking start the first

episode wasn't afraid to be edgy and

dark and it did it well I thought it was

a really good first episode that I hoped

would set the tone for the whole season

but it didn't the first episode is

probably the best in the entire season

everything else after that is just

lackluster and just kind of boring and

cliche I wouldn't call this a generic

anime though because it breaks pretty

much most traditional animate ropes for

example instead of following like the

big heroes in anime you always get like

the big dick warriors going up against

the even bigger dict enemies defying the

odds and using the power friendship and

big anime titties to beat the bad guy in

the end in this show you don't follow

that you follow some broken psychopath

who's just obsessed with cleaning up

goblins he's just like the fucking

janitor of this world just doing the

low-level tasks that everyone kind of

spits on and he is a very very cool

character but what I'm saying is it

doesn't follow those heroes in the show

they just referenced the heroes and side

characters oh the hero just defeated the

super evil bad god Lord but now we gotta

go kill some goblins and I really like

that however goblin Slayer is the only

good character in the show every other

character is super forgettable and

generic for example you have the

Argonian look and motherfucker the

Skyrim Argonian looking guy who's only

deal his only quirk is that he likes

cheese and food

there's the dwarf who only knows one

spell to shoot pebbles at a mildly fast

pace he's the world's worst earthbender

you have the elf archer who you know

she's that generic attitude girl

independent strong lady who can drink a

lot of alcohol doesn't need a man but

secretly blushes every time goblin

slayer looks at her it's a boring cast

of characters surrounding a great

character goblin slayer himself is

fantastic the other ones not so much now

the whole show is about goblin slayer

and his party going on quest that no no

wants to do because it's just killing

goblins and you know that's cool from a

conceptual level but it's not that fun

to watch play out the first episode such

this tone where goblins are grisly scary

creatures that everyone underestimates

and then they get fucked by them quite

literally and then after that they kind

of just become background enemies like

they they're not terrifying anymore

there's nothing they never do anything

too spectacular until the end again and

it just becomes a vehicle for goblin

Slayer to develop I understand that but

that doesn't make it super fun to watch

it is nice sometimes though like there

are some scenes where the goblins are

terrifying and they do some crazy shit

but it's never anything that matches the

first episode or anything even close to

that level what I do appreciate those

goblin Slayer isn't a great warrior he

just really understands goblins knows

how they think and can outsmart them

every single time with just better

strategy I fuck with that hard I thought

that was really cool instead of him just

being this overpowered muscular hunk of

a monster just fucking brutalizing

goblins by squeezing their fucking eye

sockets into oblivion

he just outsmarted everyone with good

strategy and that was cool but still the

episodes aren't good and they also rely

heavily on CGI in the beginning thank

god they stopped using so much CGI

towards the end I guess some hero at the

office stood up and said you know what

this is enough CGI for one anime CGI

animation sucks guys let's put the

brakes on this and actually just get rid

of it for the rest of it so about

halfway through it just stops using CGI

so thank God for that and I've been kind

of shitting on the middle episodes in

between the first and last two but

they're not all bad it serves to

humanize goblin Slayer he starts to open

up more and starts to learn to feel

because he's like a husk of a man and

through his quests with his party he

starts to learn to be human again so

it's nice to watch that character

develop but even still the episodes just

don't play out in a very good fashion

just really not a lot happens especially

when the first episode sets the tone of

these goblins will fuck your shit up if

you don't know what you're doing they

start to become bumbling fucking

imbeciles again in between and the

strategies that goblin Slayer employees

aren't all that clever every time

sometimes his strategy is hey shoot some

rocks at this one and I'll shoot some

fire well you know I could have fucking

figured that one out a four-year-old

with his

Lincoln Logs could have probably devised

that plan as well overall though the

shows not bad I did enjoy it and I think

the last two episodes are extremely

wholesome with a really nice payoff so

let's just go ahead and plug this shit

into the moist meter I'm giving goblins

Slayer a 65 percent it's a show that's

probably worth watching but don't expect

the first episodes tone to carry over

through the whole series because it

absolutely doesn't it seems like it

loses its way I don't know what it's

like in the manga I don't read that shit

but here it really seems like it got

almost afraid to be the same way it was

in the first episode which is a shame

because he could have he could have kept

that tone up it could've been something

special but anyway not a bad show that's

a so yeah

Moist Meter | Holmes and Watson

initiating moisture welcome to the

world's first mobile moist meter join me

today as I review Holmes and Watson

while also briefly reviewing the 20 hour

road trip from Pennsylvania to Florida

that's a fuckin zero-percent fuckin

sucks but it gives me time to get my

thoughts out about this stinker bit

Holmes and Watson is will ferrell and

john c reilly move its fucking wheels

really bad it's just not good yeah it's

fuckin shitty out of every joke falls

flat there's for some reason some very

am fisted modern political references

throughout the film even though it's

said Sherlock Holmes period like

eighteen hundreds and shit

it made Trump jokes it was like these

really bad references to modern society

and living like there's a whole joke

about selfies it's all really bad no

joke glans

the concept is nice but very poorly

executed john c reilly is the only

redeeming quality of this film even east

sucks ass well in this movie for the

most part say for one line that made me

slightly exhale from my nostrils and

asshole puckered a little bit it's just

not a good comedy at all most modern

comedies are shitty but this one is to

the next level it's hard shittier than I

expected it to be

Tianna nearly fell asleep watching

there's just not a whole lot to say

about it's a bad comedy bad move it

plugging that shit into the moist meter

giving it a 15-4 surf the only reason

it's not a 10% discount see Riley made

me exhale slightly that one time and I

guess that's something to put on the

back of the blu-ray box I suppose

definitely not worth seeing a big

fucking stinker for Christmas Day

release Santa Claus must have thought

all of America was dotty when he

delivered us this movie that's it



<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>

Moist Meter | Bumblebee

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're looking at the new

Transformers movie cue Michael Bay

explosion followed by two robots

fighting each other that looked like two

fucking coke cans getting wrapped up in

a washing machine at least that's what

transformers used to be and now

bumblebee is changing the formula I

think the the CGI and the fighting and

the new bumblebee is much better than

anything Michael Bay put on the screen

it's a lot easier to follow it's a lot

better choreography and it doesn't look

like too bent CD discs getting

intertwined and scissoring like and porn

and you can make out what's happening

and there's also some nice g1 shit from

Transformers in here which is nice as

well and that's all the compliments I

have for this movie I don't know how the

fuck this movie is getting so many

glowing reviews I have to wonder if we

watch the same movie there is nothing

special or unique about this movie

everything in this movie is incredibly

generic but it is better than the

Michael Bay's shit but that's not much

of a compliment that's like me saying

the last P I took was clearer than the P

I took before that one yeah it's still

it's still piss you know what I'm saying

one of them's just a clear form of P P

it's it's not that big of a compliment

to say it's better than Michael Bay shit

but it is it absolutely is that doesn't

mean it's worth 98% or whatever

incredible score it has on Rotten

Tomatoes there is nothing genuinely

nothing unique about this movie it's

heartwarming at times yeah it's got a

wholesome story oh fuck yeah it does but

it's a very generic one with some very

not good writing the characters are not

well written the dialogue is not good

the comedy that they tried to put in

here for the most part it's not good

there's one good comedic scene with

bumblebee and everything else is just so

incredibly formulaic expected generic

cliche John Cena's cool I'm a big John

Cena fan he was well they kind of made

him super not cool but he's a cool guy

if you're watching John Cena I like you

I respect you but you know your

character in this movies a little weak

I'll give you an example at the very end

of the

movie John Cena says to bumblebee hey

soldier and then does this to which

bumblebee goes like that's not cool

that's that's uncomfortable man that

shit's it's not even like cheesy you

know cool that's just bad the movies not

good it's not and I this is the first

time in a long time

where I completely disagree with like

the MOT the major consensus behind a

movie where everyone says this is like

the 98% in a plus plus such a good movie

and shit I wholeheartedly disagree the

dialogue between the characters is so

weak and so out of like a 90s

Nickelodeon TV show I just can't even

imagine anyone relating to it or

thinking it's well-written so I'm going

to assume that nobody listened to this

movie maybe the theater played it muted

just like bumblebee bumblebee was a

decent character but bumblebee has

always been the same character

throughout every single movie and he's

no different in this one except he's a

pussy the entire movie bumblebee is a

pussy except for the very beginning and

the very end everything in between

he's this pussy that's afraid of his own

shadow and it is cute at times but it's

it's not that cute it's it's it's

tiresome just I really don't understand

what people are seeing in this movie

that that I'm missing

apparently the romance between the main

character and the love well love

interest it's this guy that was

basically just stalking her

and the reason he gets in the megamix in

the first place because he fucking

breaks into her garage to surprise her

with a question I asked her on a date

that's like some reddit advice that this

kid was following he turned out to be an

alright character I suppose he was

relatable to some people I could see but

it's not like a good chemistry between

them and the there's so many complaints

I could give about this movie

the relationship between Hailee

Steinfeld's character Charlie and

bumblebee is really well done and

they're able to convey a lot of emotion

with bumblebee pretty much only using

his fucking eyes and that's that's

impressive and it was super cute but

there's so much in this movie you'd have

to overlook to really enjoy it and not

roll your eyes half the time for example

the military is extremely incompetent

they just can't do anything right

they're basically like fucking Team

Rocket of this movie the no decisions

they make are really well-thought-out it

seems there's also a lot of well not a

lot of but there's a couple times where

it seems the editing fucked up and they

just didn't care to fix it example being

in the final fight between bumblebee and

one of the main Decepticons he gets his

arm blasted off well it gets knocked off

and then in the exact same scene that

arm is back on him with no explanation

as to how he got his arm back it's

literally it gets knocked off and then

during the fight the arm is back on him

it made no sense and it made me feel

like they just took out like half the

fucking scene and forgot to show the arm

coming back on or they just didn't care

that's not a huge deal but it's enough

to be jarring and make you think that

you're a fucking idiot or going insane

because you just watch his arm go get

destroyed and now there it is right

there like some type of incredible magic

trick anyway though let's plug the shit

into the moist meter I'm giving

bumblebee a 60% it is not this

incredible reinvention of the

Transformers series everyone's hyping it

up today it is a heartwarming movie with

a ton of flaws

but it's enjoyable but there's not a ton

to like here it is a step in the right

direction though if they're gonna

continue pumping out Transformers movies

because this one has some great action

that is a lot easier on the eyes to

follow and a heartwarming story that's

it so yeah

Moist Meter | Smash Ultimate

initiating moisture

welcome to the moist meter today we're

finally taking a look at the new Super

Smash Bros I know we're a little tardy

does this party here this shit's been

out for like ten days which means

everyone on the Internet's pretty much

forgetting about it by now but I really

wanted to wait to do this moist meter

until I got my dick wet in this game I

wanted to play a lot of online matches I

wanted to really familiarize myself with

all the mechanics and most of the

characters and now I can say I finally

have and that I really do have a firm

grasp on the game and can review it

properly too quickly just shit on modern

games journalism most of the game

journalists that review games don't even

get past the tutorial and they're

fucking awful at the games so I didn't

want to do like a half-baked review and

review this after doing like 10

Adventure mode matches and one online

match I wanted to make sure that I could

review this is someone that really put a

lot of hours blood sweat tears and come

into the game and now that I have I can

say this game is fucking great smash

bros melee is a game that is near and

dear to my boners

I played the shit out of it for most of

my life and most of my college life I

was never extremely good but I was

middle of the pack I would run shit in

the dorm rooms it was a lot of fun I

didn't care much for brawl or smash 4 I

basically just used those discs to wipe

my ass with that shit wasn't all that

fun to me but smash ultimate is the

perfect blend of all of it it is an

extraordinarily good game all of the

characters are pretty fucking balanced

there's no unanimously awful character

even the worst character in this game

can still be played very well by a good

player and even the best player in this

game doesn't just fucking steamroll and

ham-fisted urethra of every other

character no matter how good the player

is all the characters can absolutely be

good which is surprising with a roster

this size you'd think the balancing

would be all kinds of shitted but it's

really well balanced not like in brawl

where Meta Knight was so incredibly

broken and overpowered they had to ban

him perpetually in any type of

competitive play and there had to be

House Rules when you played with their

friends that no one would have picked

Meta Knight or else your fucking we

would get fucking busted because it'd be

so frustrating or smashed 4 where

Bayonetta was undoubtedly the best

character by a long shot

this game has so many characters that

could easily be considered the best in

the game depending on who's playing them

it's really impressive how well that's

just on a personal note though I fucking

hate inkling I think if you pick inkling

Santa Claus is gonna be delivering coal

and couch it into your stocking this

year inkling is super fucking

frustrating it's just a one-trick pony

side-b in to butt-fuck can't stand that

character wouldn't say it's broken but

it's really frustrating to play against

buck inkling moving on though this game

has a really good campaign story mode

the adventure mode the adventure mode I

thought would just be kind of tacked on

and not very fun but it's pretty fucking

deep they have an RPG like system they

have spirits that you pick and choose

from catered to whatever character

you're playing as or your play style

that enhance certain aspects some that

will give you an item to start with some

will just straight and prove stats give

you an extra jump it's actually a pretty

decent system there's a skill tree as

well it's not too deep or anything

you're definitely not gonna get

overwhelmed with the choices or anything

like that it's not gonna be like path of

Exile where you zoom out and then all of

a sudden you puke because it's just so

much shit there to take in at once it's

like a fucking Harry Potter's book worth

of text to read about the skill tree and

shit the game's deep enough to keep it

fun and fresh and the adventure mode is

extremely long it's like a 24 hour

campaign using ollie Mar and my broken

spirit setup though I was able to

one-shot my way through most of the game

so it only took me an expert gamer

approximately 16 or 17 hours I believe

start to finish so I probably have the

speedrun world record at the moment on

the game and just saying I'm not I can't

prove it yet and I don't have any

scientific data to back it up but I can

say with a high degree of confidence I'm

probably up in the top 5 the speedruns

there this story of the adventure mode

is nothing to write home about it's

really bare-bones it's it's not anything

impressive or anything like that but I

don't think anyone's buying smash bros

to be blown away by a story they want to

just have some fucking fun with their

friends and just smash like shit and

this game is perfect than that you can

get your fucking boys together crack

open a couple Budweiser's on your

forehead snuggle up next to each other

and some nice cozy pajamas and just have

a fucking blast playing Smash Bros it's

a really fun game it's not as technical

as melee I don't think personally but

then again I'm not a top-tier player at

this yet so probably maybe there is more

under the hood to this than

I currently understand my little reptile

brain may not have been wrapped around

everything the game has to offer yet but

so far it doesn't seem as technical as

Mele was which isn't a complaint it

doesn't need to be its technical enough

to be a big gap between a regular player

and a very good player there's a lot of

competitiveness to this game and it's a

really good competitive fighter now

let's move on to my only big complaints

here and it's the online the online is

trash it's some filthy fucking anus it

is really poor there's not a whole lot

of options and it's so primitive

Nintendo is stuck in like the late 90s

with their multiplayer understanding

they just don't get it this shit is an

archaic fossil of multiplayer and you

have to pay for it too which is just an

insult they're just spitting in your

face

it's 2018 when you have to pay for an

online multiplayer service it's a joke I

wouldn't be surprised if soon Nintendo

requires you to downgrade the dial-up to

use their services online

they make you type in a fucking friend

code if you want a friend request

someone without being in the same lobby

it's room codes instead of searching for

specific rooms or a host or anything

like that

it's just so baffling how out of touch

they are with 2018 multiplayer it's

almost laughable if it wasn't so sad

because the game's great and it really

hampers the experience when trying to

play online not only is it just

primitively designed but once you're in

the game the network can't really hold

itself up super well so you would be

landing in these really laggy rooms

where you're gonna go frame by frame

like a PowerPoint slide show when

playing against somebody it's just rough

the online is super rough it could

easily be fixed with a patch I think if

they put some effort into it and maybe

learn how multiplayer is done these days

instead of taking notes from a textbook

they found in an Egyptian sarcophagus

about multiplayer compatibility because

if they could just fix that this game

would be everything Smash Bros needed to

be it has everything that most people

wanted a great cast of characters more

characters to come as well it looks like

they're going to be constantly updating

it with balance changes already coming

out it's just a very very good game

but the multiplayer just holds it the

online multiplayer just holds it back so

fucking much and is a huge shit stain on

an otherwise nearly flawless product and

I know you can absolutely argue that

there are other flaws with this game but

I feel like they're so trivial in

comparison to what the game brings that

I don't even think it's worth wasting

breath talking about them let's go ahead

and plug this shit into the moist meter

I'm giving in smash bros ultimate a 90%

the game is extraordinary it's extremely

fun and it's just held back by a

starting startling ly bad multiplayer

not just because of really bad practices

from Nintendo and not understanding

multiplayer but even the actual

multiplayer itself doesn't function as

well as it needs to and it's

surprisingly limited in the options that

it has but otherwise the game is perfect

if you want to just play with your

friends it's a great game even he just

want to play by yourself and do like

story mode or against CPUs it's just a

great fucking game I do think this is

probably the best smash game overall and

I don't say that lightly with how

closely attached I am to melee I have

been absolutely loving smash ultimate

that's it so yeah

Moist Meter | Mortal Engines

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter we're looking at mortal engines

yes so it's it's a big fucking letdown

I'll go ahead and let the let the come

out of the condom right away I'll spoil

that it's it's a huge disappointment

from a conceptual standpoint absolutely

fucking love it

predator cities eating one another

they're on wheels fucking mad max-style

just eating other cities and other

settlements that's fucking great just

naanum up me spitting out the dick it

sounds fucking great and it looks great

visually this movie's fantastic but you

only see that one time you only see some

city on City cannibalism one time in the

very beginning of this movie and then

you don't see it ever again then it

becomes a pretty boring love story slash

revenge story with really really weak

characters and a pretty shitty plot

that's just so fast-moving it makes no

sense at all and also the main character

gets chased by some omniscient zombie

who somehow can just smell where she is

at all points in time and the main

reason the zombies trying the catcher is

pretty fucking dumb it's it's such a

shame because visually the movies great

I loved the universe here I think it's

absolutely great cities on wheels the

technology super fucking cool the set

design it's just really nice to look at

it truly is but it is so underutilized

it's insulting absolutely insulting they

choose this great universe and then to

focus on the most boring parts of it I

don't understand I know is the books

whatever but god damn why couldn't you

at least do cool shit for the movie and

they they wanted to just blast through

the whole fucking book in under two

hours it's it didn't work not at all you

didn't care about any of the characters

cuz none of them were that great to

begin with a lot of them were just

comically bad and generic a lot of the

scenes were really bad and generic

you'll have like a gunfight scene that

it looks like straight out of a ps1

cutscene not saying like it looks bad

CGI or anything but like the action just

looks bad it's

it's just generic bang-bang-bang and

then like shaky-cam if there's any fist

fighting it's just really bad like it

hurts because I love the setting in the

concept but fuck they took a shit on

that real quick but I mean there are

some good things to say about it the

settings great I can say I can say that

over and over again I fucking love the

universe in here visuals are great

there's like some folding city shit you

know everything good that happens in

this movie happens at the beginning I'm

starting to realize because you start to

see this that's when you actually see

the cities and shit you know fold and

eat each other and after that then it's

just hey let's you know get revenge I

love you that's another thing they say I

love you like almost immediately like

they look at each other and just they

make that connection I guess that's kind

of inspiring too you know nobody but

it's you know fuck yeah I'm actually

upset about the movie because I do think

there's just so much potential with that

awesome fucking concept the cities

eating each other there's just so many

goddamn complaints I could fire at you

right now I could just fart them all at

you real quick but I'm just I'm not I'm

gonna spare you that I'll give you a

couple though the main villain sucks

asshole the main villain just really bad

he's just a cartoonishly evil guy with

just you know there's really no reason

for him to be that evil they don't

really explain why is evil or what his

motivations are just evil for the sake

of being evil maybe power I guess I

could see that a little bit he just he's

a bad villain he's a bad character too

fucking bad the dialogue is so bad

dialogues real bad there's some real

shit bad dialogue in this entire movie

there's a Minion's reference they go to

a museum and there's minions there that

they fucking shoehorned in there and

just threw in your face I don't know why

but they were in there so if you like

the minions we'll see them for a second

I guess let's just plug the shit into

the moist meter I'm giving mortal Injuns

of 30% the only reason it's that high is

because the visuals are so nice and

admittedly there's a couple good scenes

well there's not many

yeah there's absolutely not many not at

all it's just not good it's fuck it's a

fucking shame that's it so yeah

Moist Meter | Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're looking at the new

spider-man movie spider-man into the

spider verse it's very rare in 2018 that

you'll find a Spider Man animation

without spider-man's dick and Elsa's

mouth but Sony has done just that they

made a brand new spider-man animation

and surprisingly it is tied for the best

animated movie I've ever seen in my life

it's tied with redline turn the wrong

way like a fucking idiot but it's tied

with red line which is my favorite

animated movie ever made and this is

right up there with it I might even say

this is a better animated movie than red

line and that shit right there is not

something I say lightly that's fucking

blasphemy to me red line is nearly

unmatched in terms of animation until

now this movie is so aesthetically

pleasing and visually stunning

everything is so stylized I'm sure if

Myles farted on screen and come with

like a couple comic-book bubble flying

out of his asshole and it would look

great every move in this movie is

fucking fantastic to look at every

action scene every travel scene

everything is just so fucking beautiful

it's amazing the visuals in this movie

are unmatched

it is truly breathtaking and it's got a

rut it's got a nice little story it's

heartwarming with some emotional moments

it gets dark as well sometimes and it

brings some great new characters to the

screen yeah at fucking Nicolas Cage noir

spider-man over watched Evo spider-man

Porky Pig spider-man spider ham they're

all fucking cool little characters

albeit those characters aren't really

explored or fleshed out or anything

they're just kind of there is comedic

characters that kind of do some badass

things occasionally but they're not very

important to this story the main

characters are Miles Peter Peter Parker

and Gwyn and they're great characters

there's no bad characters in this movie

because they're all well-written the

entire movie is super well written no

thing I'd say in that department is some

of the one-liners don't land when a

spider-man's big gimmick is the

one-liners so when you have fucking 50

spider people coming out of nowhere all

doing one-liner it's not all we're gonna

work to be expected that's not a huge

complaint or anything it's hard to

believe that the studio that made this

is the same one that shit out the emoji

movie it's it's unreal

I can't even fucking imagine that that

would be like is if little pump secretly

wrote all of Mozart's material it's such

an incredible turnaround from the emoji

movie I just don't understand how the

fuck they were capable of this greatness

but then also shit out the emoji movie

I'm happy it's been realized here though

and we have spider-man into the spider

verse because this shit is fucking

incredible it is an amazing movie the

soundtrack is something else I'd like to

point out I really enjoyed the

soundtrack in this movie

yeah the score fits super well in all

the scenes when they interlace the

action and shit with some music it was

really fun to watch I was I think most

people who appreciate all the little

Easter eggs that are thrown throughout

the movie a lot of little you know

tidbits of spider-man Laurens shit

poking fun at itself at some points

poking fun at superhero shit at others

and of course there's a Stan Lee cameo

in here rest in peace mr. Stan Lee

excelsior he's in this bad boy and he's

got a really touching scene and that was

cute and the whole movies just pretty

heartwarming overall with the messages

and the story it's a really fuckin great

movie and I can't stress that enough

probably the best animated movie I've

ever seen and I'm saying that right in

front of red line too and it hurts it

fucking hurts but the movie really is

just that good I do have a major

complaint however and that is that

kingpin his motivation he's the main

villain and his motivation is just

pretty shitty his plan is pretty fucking

abysmal I'm not gonna spoil anything but

even if if kingpin accomplished his plan

without spider-man intervening he would

have still been fucked he wanted to

unfuck himself with his plan but even if

he did he'd still fuck himself it's hard

it's hard to explain I'm sure if you've

seen the movie will understand what I'm

saying

but no matter what would have happened

if spider-man didn't step in kingpin

would have come out on the bottom he

would not have won his plan just didn't

work

his motivation his motivation was an

emotional one they did that well but it

just didn't make sense

it drove the plot it led to the you know

a lot of spider people coming in and

that was great but he was just a pretty

weak villain in terms of his motivation

very fun one to watch on screen and

there is that bit of emotion they gave

to him but like I said his plans is

pretty shitty overall let's plug this

shit into the moist mute

I'm giving spider-man into the

spider-verse and 95% this is probably

one of the best superhero movies in

general ever made and honestly probably

the best animated movie ever made

beating out redline ever so fucking

slightly and just ever so slightly if

there's a red line to coming I hands

down that'll beat this one but I don't

think we're gonna see a red line too

unfortunately but this isn't here to cry

about red line this is to praise the new

spider-man movie because it's really

fucking good that's it so yeah

Moist Meter | Darksiders 3

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter polygons calling it the dark souls

of game reviews today we're looking at

Darksiders 3

Darksiders is a series that's very near

and dear to my boners I'm a big fan of

the dark Sider series I love the first

two games the first one more so than the

second and I was beyond shocked that

this game even got released now this

game is getting absolutely fucking

grilled by the micro dict everything's

problematic games journalists out there

and I don't think it's entirely

warranted this game has many many

problems which I'll cover but this game

has something most modern games are

lacking soul passion real passion put

into the project when you beat the

fucking game there's a there's a message

that says of special thanks to the fans

and family members of the team who

supported us in our pursuit to create

awesome games

it was the most wholesome moment I've

ever had in videogames when I beat that

shit and saw the credits roll nearly

brought a goddamn tear to my eye the

game truly is a labor of love from the

team I really want the game to do well

even though I don't think it's a great

game or anything I would love to see

more from Darksiders because I think

this had a lot of potential but due to

the low budget and time constraints it

really did miss the mark unfortunately

of the three Darksiders games this is

easily the weakest everything feels

super rushed from the story to the

gameplay to the characters it really

shows its low budget and time problems

because like the lip-sync is really bad

it's fucking abominable the lip-sync

looks like straight out of a DOS box

game from the late 90s the story jumps

all over the place one second fury

thinks humans are insects and hates them

thinks they should all die and she

doesn't care and then the next scene

she's all of a sudden giving a big

fucking pep talk to the humans like a

quarterback in the locker room hyping up

his team before the big championship

game and there's nothing to connect

those two points all the sudden fury

will have a moment of self-reflection

but for no reason there was no catalyst

nothing that really brought that about I

think the team had a clear direction

they wanted to take this story but they

couldn't get there they couldn't flush

it out and develop it because they

didn't have the time

or the budget to do so so instead you

get these jarring transitions and

nothing really connects also the

gameplay gets really clunky the dodging

is really picky with what they consider

a perfect dodge and also what is even a

dodge to begin with the camera will

actively do its best to fuck you in the

ass hole the lock-on scarcely works and

when it does it's not super helpful it

makes it a little bit more confusing

when there's mobs when there's mobs you

may as well just give up start praying

because it all boils down to luck if

you're gonna survive the encounter the

game's difficulty is super high but not

like a Dark Souls way like all the games

about all the game journalists are

saying like this is Dark Souls meets

Darksiders or whatever the fuck it's

nothing like Dark Souls the only thing

that has in common is they're both hard

games but Dark Souls is hard but fair

Darksiders 3 is hard but unfair there's

no chance in some of the encounters when

you get to them for the first time

because there's nothing you can do about

it you wouldn't expect it you'll just

get jumped from someone around the

corner and they'll 2-shot you because

almost everything two shots you a

fucking enemy could fart on you and I'll

take out half your health and there's

really just nothing you can do about it

you just have to sit there and get

fucking beef stewed and stink faced by

the enemies because the dodging doesn't

really work and there's no blocking but

all this being said all of these

negatives

Darksiders 3 has this undeniable charm

about it it's a very old-fashioned kind

of game from a time when games didn't

have like a meta to stick to where it

wasn't only big-budget titles that had

to play it safe where everything was

just by the numbers no risk taken it

comes from an era of games where

developers would just throw a bunch of

shit at the wall and hope something

stuck and that's when Darksiders was

originally born and it still has that

charm from back then and I really

appreciate that the world is very nice I

think the art direction is fantastic and

it does have a good overarching story to

tell even though they didn't have time

to flush it out and really make you care

all that much it still has an

interesting story to tell not as good as

the previous two but still good I liked

most of the characters the dialogue at

points got pretty fucking bad though the

dialogue really tried to make fury kind

of edgy but she just kind of came across

as like an asshole edge Lord and not

just her dialogue pretty much all the

dialogue

in the game is not super great there's

some good lines here and there but the

strength of the the writing comes from

just the story and building the world

and I really appreciate that

I thought the boss design of the seven

deadly sins was spectacular I thought

each boss looked really fucking cool

with a fun little move set and gimmicks

to them while the gameplay wasn't super

tight it was enjoyable at points when it

worked it worked well it's at its best

when you're only fighting one enemy when

you're one-on-one you can get some cool

moments and a good fight out of it but

even if there's two enemies it's gonna

feel really unfair it's gonna feel like

there's not a whole lot you can do about

the kinda situation unless you've

leveled yourself up well or got really

good enhancements and the reason is

mainly because when there's more than

one enemy the camera just doesn't know

what to do with itself and if you try

and lock-on just fucking turn off the

game because the lock-on is awful in a

2v1 situation or more you'll just start

swinging at the air and it's gonna be

disorienting the puzzles in this game I

thought were actually very well

thought-out some of the puzzles took

quite a bit of thinking and when you did

solve it it was like this nice Eureka

moment that felt good it not as good as

like Legend of Zelda or even the

previous two games but they were still

nice and they're fun I always enjoy

puzzle solving shit and hack and slash

games and here they were pretty well

designed overall I'd absolutely say I

enjoyed the game and I'm super happy it

got made and I really do hope it does

well enough sales wise to warrant a

fourth installment into this series with

a bigger budget and more time because

this game showed a lot of potential to

be great but unfortunately it just

couldn't get there I'm gonna go ahead

and plug this shit into the moist meter

now I'm giving Darksiders to a 60% while

it does have many flaws I don't think

any of them make a game unplayable or

completely unenjoyable they're

definitely a lot of frustrating aspects

about the game however I would recommend

this one to anyone who enjoys hack and

slash puzzle solving games or just wants

a very challenging game this one will

definitely fucking test your patience

that's for sure and overall I do think

it was a decently good game so yeah

that's it

so yeah

Moist Meter | Ralph Breaks The Internet

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter bringing you sodden statistics in

3d today we're looking at the new

wreck-it Ralph Ralph bricks the Internet

I had never seen the first wreck-it

Ralph until before going to see this

when I watched it like three hours

before going to see the new one I

fucking loved it the movie was

absolutely beautiful to look at it was

incredibly cute with a beautiful tribute

to videogames and then you go into this

movie and it's a tribute to the the

human patience the movies just a fucking

disappointment compared to the first one

it seems so goddamn soulless passionless

and just like this huge cash grab Disney

titty twisted the nipples of the studio

to make a sequel to wreck-it Ralph

you're gonna make a sequel no you're

gonna make Ralph do fortnight dances we

won't you're gonna make him talk about

memes alright fuck leave us alone Disney

and so then you get this disgusting

undead husk of a sequel to wreck-it

Ralph it's not a bad movie I wouldn't go

as far as I call it a bad movie by any

means but it is an incredibly

disappointing movie and absolutely

passionless and it shows this movie's

story is it has a cute little message

but there's no conflict in this story

it's all about Ralph's being obsessed

clingy friend

it makes Ralph the villain you know he

and the final boss being his

insecurities there's really not a whole

lot that goes on here that's fun to

watch or that's even powerful it has a

pretty brave ending I'd say but

everything up to that is just a boring

slog and it's just about him being

obsessed with a little girl which is a

bit odd he just forgets all his other

friends and focuses on being obsessed

with her and the characters just don't

really do anything it asks fists a bunch

of Disney property in here in product

placement it's just the years a bunch of

Disney Princesses for a little while

here's Star Wars guardians of the galaxy

you guys like Disney shit here's here's

some Disney shit take it the jokes in

this movie are all just like hey you

guys have seen memes right well Ralph's

looking at memes hahaha isn't that dope

Rob's doing memes he does screaming goat

memes he does fortnight dances you guys

like fucking fortnight look at Ralph do

fortnight shit and that's that's the

whole

jokes of the movie it's all supposed to

be just like relatable oh you guys use

the internet we understand the Internet

Rolf doesn't look how goofy Ralph is he

thinks Instagram isn't about showing

your tits and asses all over the place

how dumb is that so then you got

snapchat Instagram Pinterest and Ralph

visits them for a second

it's it's lifeless absolutely lifeless

it doesn't seem like there's any soul

behind this movie that being said there

are some great scenes when they do video

game shit they do it real well there's a

game in here called slaughter race and

it has this beautiful race that's like a

mad max-style showdown it's fucking

great there's also a really good musical

scene in here that takes place in

slaughter race you'll excuse to fine if

you see this movie the only good shit

that happens in this movie happens in

slaughter race or around slaughter race

everything else is just jerking off

Disney property product placement and

really yucky memeing like I said it just

feels like Disney was pulling the

strings and forcing the studio to dance

on the grave of wreck-it Ralph what do

kids like wreckit-ralph was popular am I

still like wreck-it Ralph what else do

they like memes combine them brilliant

Johnson we're gonna combine both worlds

I don't care if it works do it fucking

do it and that's what you get here you

know the animation is great and the

voice acting great but it is so

incredibly disappointing I don't

understand why people seem to be

enjoying this one more than the first

apparently this is truly the most

by-the-numbers cash-grab

I could have imagined you just take a

beloved character and force him into

like a relatable Internet cultured style

movie it's just really not that you know

inspired it's just unfortunate

let's plug this shit into the moisture

meter I'm giving the new wreck-it Ralph

a 70% like I said it is not a bad movie

there is a lot of cool shit that happens

here but overall it's just this big

fucking cash grab that's the only way I

can explain this one I don't understand

there's no way they ever planned on

making a wreck it Ralph sequel and if

they did they certainly did not want him

coming in here and making B puns for

viral videos in this movie it's dumb

it's not what you would

spec from the character and I don't

think every sequel or anything needs to

be like the same kind of characters

doing the same type of shit I respect

them they do different things but when

it's so different that it just seems

disingenuous to the original characters

that's when you have a problem this

whole movie just feels like taking a

beloved character that people already

know and then making him go through meme

culture because people understand memes

and they were hoping they could make a

lot of money off of that novelty I hope

it doesn't work because I don't want to

see more sequels like this I'd hate to

see the characters from up venturing

their way onto the internet next you

know oh now he's flying his hot air

balloon house into the cloud oh my God

look at that he's entered into the

internet ello now he's doing four at

night dances cool I'd hate to see more

sequels like this when I really would

that's it so yeah

Moist Meter | Fantastic Beasts: Crimes of GrindelWald

initiating moisture welcome to the

magical world of moisture today we're

looking at the new fantastic beast movie

I'm a huge fan of the Wizarding World I

enjoyed the Harry Potter series and I

really really enjoyed the first

fantastic beasts movie I thought it was

superb

I enjoyed everything that I was setting

up I enjoyed the movie start to finish

the new Fantastic beast movies a fucking

wet fart right in my face giving me a

goddamn pink eye it was bad it was not a

good movie I wouldn't say it was a

terrible movie I didn't hate it but it

is it poorly made very poorly edited and

just confusing movie from the beginning

to the end let's start with what I think

is the weakest part of this movie in the

narrative the plot of this movie is so

confusing and choppy it seems like the

editing was so incredibly rushed they'll

have a scene that ends abruptly and then

the next scene that starts and the two

just don't match you'll have characters

in a tomb in one scene and then all of a

sudden they're outside of the tomb and

completely separated and you have no

idea why because they were just having

an argument in that tomb so what the

fuck happened in there they all just

jerk each other off and they're all good

now in this next area for no reason you

don't know why did the whole movie the

whole narrative is just so poorly told

and constructed with so many moving

parts it's impossible to keep up with

you're also left with a lot of loose

ends and convenient coincidences such as

you know I thought your mind was erased

it wasn't oh that's all okay yeah I

guess it wasn't

they just retcon without what happened

in the last movie sometimes oh that ship

crashed what why did the ship crash

yeah just crashed convenient oh okay

that makes sense and you just have to

just bite that shit down and cuz JK

Rowling says so there's no explanation

for some of the things that happen in

the air there's no wise it's just this

happened don't you dare ask a fucking

question I'm JK fucking rolling it's

it's a shame because I thought fantastic

beasts did a great job storytelling and

presenting some very nice visuals this

movie has some great visuals I really

loved the magic in here there's a lot of

unique spells and a lot of very cool

settings but the plot that's supposed to

hold it all together and drive things

forward is awful truly dogshit and it's

also like Thai

into not to spoil anything it's tying

into like real world history all of a

sudden now Hitler is gonna play a role

in the Harry Potter universe it makes no

fucking sense things are just happening

just because Rowling says so without any

real connection or reason for those

things to happen I'm not exaggerating

quite literally they're setting the

stage for Hitler to play a role in the

fantastic beast universe it's absolutely

nonsensical and what's crazy is she's

got a lot of likeable characters here

there's almost no characters in this

movie that I don't like I think all of

them are very strong well-rounded

characters that you start to care for

but my god the plot that she throws them

in just tries it's best to spit in their

face it's bad and there's also the worst

self-sacrifice I've seen in theaters

ever there's a self-sacrifice from a

character that is the most underwhelming

thing I've ever seen on the screen for a

self-sacrifice it'd be as if a man

jumped on a samurai sword to stop a

piece of pizza from hitting the ground

and killed himself doing that it's just

why would you bother killing yourself

for that outcome it was so underwhelming

not to spoil anything again but someone

kills themselves to knock something over

and it didn't knocking that thing over

wasn't like integral it wasn't anything

important they just killed themselves to

knock something over and they were an

important character like why why did

that happen

I understand why because it's supposed

to be more motivation for the other

characters are supposed to be emotional

but you can't help but think it's just

silly like he's that really the best we

could send that character out with a big

bang in a new raw knocking something

over amazing it's just like an angry

Magic the Gathering player flipping over

a fucking table and then having a heart

attack it's stupid man I can't I can't

vent enough about how weak I thought

this plot was and they're all so and JK

Rowling really seems to be doing her

best not to step on her own lore but she

is still fucking rampaging through it a

lot of this shit just does not really

fit into the the Wizarding World that's

already been established maybe it will

in the sequels they'll go back and fix

some shit up but right now a lot of shit

just doesn't match you're getting new

information that contradicts what you're

already supposed to know from the world

she's created so I think she's really

having a hard time here like I said

great characters

great visuals another thing all of the

wizards in the fantastic beasts are far

stronger than every wizard you saw in

Harry Potter every single fucking wizard

in this movie is stronger than any of

them from the Harry Potter movies all of

them could have fucking manhandled

Voldemort in Harry Potter they used to

spells basically ad nauseam fantastic

beasts they're using a spell for

everything that can peel come out of

penises from two miles away and then use

that to figure out what human being is

gonna be born from those sperm cells

it's incredible the magic they're using

here is so far beyond everything we saw

in Harry Potter and I don't know if

that's a good thing or a bad thing

because I think since Harry Potter takes

place later on the magic should be a bit

better there as it gets refined and

improved but I don't mind because I like

seeing it in the fantastic beasts movie

I also much prefer the setting of

fantastic beasts I mean honestly the

movie aside from the narrative the plot

isn't bad it's not like a bad movie I

don't regret seeing it but man it's so

disappointing coming from fantastic

beasts one which I liked and pretty much

all the Harry Potter's except for Goblet

of Fire which I all thought were very

strong excluding Goblet of Fire

obviously it's this one is just such a

disappointment a lot of it is just

utterly pointless it seems like all of

it is so trivial in the world that even

setting up for a sequel seems like all

of this information is useless that none

of it really has much of an effect it's

just such a shame in my opinion we're

gonna plug this shit into the moist

meter giving the new Fantastic Beast

movie a 40 percent like I said I don't

regret seeing it I did enjoy the visuals

another thing that I forgot to mention

the action has so many lazily put

together cuts and chops you cannot keep

up with it the very first opening with

the escape and the chase is damn near

impossible to look at there's so much

flashing lights in your face you feel

like you're at a rave it cuts in between

each line that is spoken or each scream

or each yell or each action you cannot

put that shit together your minds gonna

try its best to make sense of what's

happening and it's not going to work the

movie is just really bad when it comes

to showing you action or anything really

moving because it cuts so many times

it's stupid but like I said don't regret

seeing it it's not it's the worst movie

in the Wizarding World

I think it's even worse than Goblet of

Fire but even still visuals are fun and

I really like the universe and the

characters are good but it's I wouldn't

consider this a good movie let's see

Moist Meter | Overlord

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're looking at Overlord

which is the new Wolfenstein movie or at

least that's what the trailers make it

look like and I was ready to fucking

spew my gamer gunk all over the place

watching a Wolfenstein movie but

unfortunately it's not really like a

Wolfenstein movie despite what the

trailers show us it's still a really

good movie I was thoroughly entertained

but the trailers aren't exactly true to

what the product is this is more of just

a world war ii movie that you know some

Band of Brothers type shit but it's very

well done it's beautiful to look at with

amazing sound design and there's also

some monsters sometimes they're not

really important overall nor do they

play that big of a role they're not like

the fucking quarterback of this football

team of a movie but it's nice that

they're there I really enjoy every time

one of the monsters is on the screen and

unfortunately that's the only thing

interesting in terms of the narrative of

this movie it really is just super

formulaic and generic in that department

you have the standard a super nice guy

who doesn't want to kill anyone or

anything they tell a story about how he

couldn't even kill a mouse there's also

generic love interest that isn't really

explored as a brother that gets

kidnapped which isn't really important

then there's the standard no-nonsense

badass who eats nails for breakfast and

pisses out motor oil who's gonna jerk

off all the Jerry's he hates Nazis and

just wants to fuck them all up just a

generic cast of characters but they're

fun they're there to you know push the

narrative the pretty weak narrative at

that but it's fun it's a it's an

entertaining movie it's a really

colorful movie it's beautiful to look at

and like the first 20 30 minutes of this

movie I thought were fucking spectacular

I thought it was an incredible

introduction and I was really hoping it

would keep that kind of pace throughout

the entire film which it doesn't it

really starts to drag in the middle and

gets extremely fucking by-the-numbers

and formulaic but the first 30 minutes I

thought were just fucking jaw-dropping

and great to look at the whole movie

is great to look at and the sound design

is something I really need to point out

because it's super fucking well done

it's it's hard to put

words because you'd have to see it to

really appreciate it but it's impressive

I almost still like Blade Runner levels

it impressive in my opinion but not

quite to that level it's just a fun

movie you would expect from the trailers

you know maybe they go to a Nazi science

facility they get captured then they

have to fight their way out through

monsters and Nazis you know gore and

guts flying over the pole over the place

titties and rock and roll you don't get

that you get war movie with a couple of

monsters occasionally there's still gore

not as much as you'd expect from like

the the grindhouse B horror movie vibe

you got from the trailers but there is

gore and it's well done it's just a fun

movie overall but can't help but be

disappointed or misled by the trailers

because they kind of promised you

something that you don't get in this it

also kind of hypes up the horror aspect

of this movie but there's literally no

horror in this at all unless you're

easily disturbed by you know German

language or perhaps like a moderately

repulsing monster there's really nothing

to find frightening in this movie I

don't think anyone's gonna go to bed

with the lights on fearing for Nazi

scientists breaking into their room at

night and stealing their nightmares or

something there's just nothing scary

so to hype it up as a horror movie I

think is disingenuous as well the story

like I said super generic I'll go ahead

and sum it summarize it in a nutshell

here this group is given the mission of

destroying a tower near this town and

that's the that's the whole story it

doesn't really get deeper than that it's

like alright boys we're gonna destroy

that fucking tower oh my god that's a

nazi zombie monster abomination damn

that's that's scary shit we're still

gonna blow up that Tower

but the fact that that exists is

something that I'm going to remember and

we're still blowing at that Tower that's

the whole movie it doesn't really get

deeper than that then there's like this

really loose love connection between the

main character and a girl that happens

to speak English French and German in

the town it's just very uninspired but I

really like the concept of having the

nazi zombie monsters in there and I wish

it played a bigger role and I wish that

was like a focal point of the movie damn

we came here for Nazis and now we're

fighting demons spawns from Hell that

are also Nazis we gotta fucking destroy

everything let's just blow shit up and

or everywhere let it it's not it that's

not that's not what you get here it's a

good movie I was thoroughly entertained

it dragged a lot in the middle though

but the beginning and the end I thought

were really very strong and overall the

movie was just a very nice one to look

at and enjoy so let's pop overlord into

the moist meter I'm giving this bitch a

70% good movie definitely would

recommend it I absolutely think it's

worth the time and that's it so yeah

Moist Meter | Red Dead Redemption 2

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter is Red Dead Redemption to the best

videogame that has ever been made in

humanity's crowning achievement that

will change the landscape of video games

and modern science as we know it no no

does not now I know me just making that

statement that Red Dead Redemption 2 is

not the best thing humanity's ever made

has immediately turned the soft cock of

the blinded lobotomize Rockstar fanboys

into a hard cock but please calm down

let me explain this game is

extraordinary it is nothing should I

have an extremely impressive game in a

very good game at that but there is just

so much wrong with this that I feel all

the major publications and reviewers are

just brushing off because they don't

wanna you know poke the sleeping bear

shake the hornet's nest of the fucking

zombie Rockstar fanboys that blindly

think that everything Rockstar does is

the best thing ever made and it's a

shame because when you're reviewing a

game the whole fucking point is to point

out the good in the bad and you know

come up with a verdict of is this game

worth your time as a consumer so I'm

gonna talk about the issues but let me

talk about what's so good about the game

real quick

the writing is second to none it's

nothing shy of awe-inspiring how much

dialogue there is in this game the

fucking voice actors in this game must

have had to just quit everything else

they were doing for a full year to

deliver all of the unique lines of

dialogue in here the lines are acted

beautifully the writing is stellar the

characters really feel like they exist

in this universe it feels like we're

just peeking into an actual real

universe somewhere along the fucking

multiverse spectrum because this is just

amazing

I've never really seen characters that

come alive like these do and the story

is up to par with the characters as well

the story delivers some great set pieces

some great moments and it's just really

well-written overall so it complements

all the great characters that exist in

the world and the world is absolutely

amazing breathtaking the environment the

all the creatures the towns you know

from the fucking dirt muddy towns out in

the outskirts somewhere in the world all

the way to the beautiful more modern

landscape of saint-denis all

is so fucking lovely to look at and it's

filled with characters that really kind

of bring the towns to life however when

you go outside of the towns you're kind

of traversing from point A to point B

the world really feels pretty empty

because it's so big there's so much

space that they just couldn't really

fill all of it so it just kind of seems

like you're wandering around an endless

void of nothing until you get to the

towns but even wandering around that

open landscape isn't that bad because

it's so lovely to look at and to

experience and then it has great sound

to complement it so you'll get some like

spaghetti-western shit coming in with

like a tumbleweed falling down with this

and you understand what I mean it feels

like a fucking Western it sounds like a

Western and it looks absolutely amazing

now let me get to the complaints now

this game has been really championing

immersion making immersion the focal

point here this game will change

immersion and this game is incredible in

that regard this game is some of the

most realistic shit I've ever seen in a

video game to a fault they really take

immersion too far in my opinion video

games shouldn't be this realistic for a

good reason let me give you an example

you go to a house you've killed the

people there and you open the cabinets

to start looting there's eight cans of

beans in most video games you take all

eight cans of beans or just tap it quick

enough to take all eight cans of beans

well in this game you take each one

individually but there's an animation

that plays for it each time and it's a

fucking thorough check of each can of

beans you take the can of beans you look

at the can of beans you look it over up

and down make sure there's no

perforation so holes in there you read

the nutrition facts you check out the

food label look at the ingredients and

then you take that can of beans fucking

20 seconds later you do that eight times

it's tedious it's not fun yeah you know

it's realistic because you can't just

walk into a house and telepathically

take all eight cans of beans but I don't

think you need to do like a fucking

police pat down on each can of beans

that in the fucking house you're looting

there should just be the option to take

all and another thing the controls are

very clunky so when you are doing this

looting shit you have to find the

perfect tile to even get the prompt to

pop up to pick up the shit and to start

looting and looting is another huge

complaint because you have the

individual

Lieut the people you kill which has its

own six second animation that plays so

you kills you kill a whole town of

people let's say a whole gang the old

Driscoll's you take out all neo

Driscoll's in one specific area and then

you have to go loot each one

individually let's say there were twenty

people there it takes six seconds to

loot one body on average that's a lot of

fucking time spent just looting people

that's not fun that's not a good

gameplay mechanic it takes immersion to

a level I don't think should be reached

in video games because it's just not

conducive to the the medium yeah it's

gonna be fun to do that and be like wow

this is so realistic for maybe like the

first five or six hours of the game I'd

say then the novelty wears off and then

you get into a routine okay let's

complete this mission all right let's

start looting fuck this is gonna take an

extra 10 minutes even though I've

already done all the hard part now I'm

just sitting here for 10 minutes looting

these fucking bodies it loses its

novelty you know if it only did that for

the beginning parts or you could turn it

off after a certain period of time

that'd be just fine and it'd be great

and nothing but a positive but the fact

that you have to do this each and every

time fucking sucks the game is obviously

a very slow-paced game very slow

build-up game the whole pacing of the

game is very slow that's not a negative

however it becomes a negative when every

single mission is so formulaic that it

goes like this you accept the mission

and then you get a 10-minute you know

galloping trotting excuse me trotting

scene where you're trotting to the

mission objective where you can't go

faster because it just won't let you and

you're having ten minutes of small talk

luckily the small talk is well-written

so it helps cushion that blow but it's

still a long fucking time I'm just

trotting along with your partner to the

mission objective for the most part

obviously there's exceptions and it's

always on Rails you can't really

approach missions in too many unique

ways if you go a little too far out of

where they want you to go instant

mission fail it's just it's a shame

there should be a little more freedom

with the missions how you approach them

where you go how you get to the missions

etc and there should be a way of

dictating the fucking speed that you get

to the missions yeah I understand the

writings great and the small talk is

often kind of fun to listen to but

please let me dictate the speed at which

we go to have this small talk GTA you

know there is small talk in the car but

it's a fucking car you can

get there as fast as you want to get

there on a horse you don't really have

that luxury so you're just stuck there

with your whole fist in your ass

listening in the same idle chitchat

you've already heard before over the

last 10 or 12 hours of your adventure

and the last major complaint I have

about this game is it's the exact same

game that we got eight years ago at the

first read that the gameplay hasn't

changed it hasn't evolved there anything

I'm not saying it needs to be innovative

and not saying I need to reinvent the

condom or anything like that but it's

exactly the same Rockstar hasn't changed

their gameplay in the last 15 or so

years except for Max Payne 3 to a

certain extent this gameplay is clunky

it feels dated it feels like it's still

stuck in 2010 yaks functional gets the

job done but it's not anything special

it's not anything that's I'd never say

it's a good thing it's just like oh this

is a great game great story great

characters and I guess there's some

gameplay in there it's not anything that

I'd be excited to tell people about like

hey you got to try this shit out check

out this gameplay because it's just so

bland and just overly safe I would have

liked to see a little bit more in the

gameplay side of things now let me clear

up some confusion because I already know

it's gonna be a contentious point me

saying the gameplay is exactly the same

the gameplay is very different in this

than other Rockstar titles in terms of

the mechanics with the immersion

features as well as just the general

exploratory shit the gameplay is

different what I'm talking about when I

say it's dated and clunky the same

Rockstar shit is the combat the combat

just hasn't changed at all it's exactly

the same as it was a decade ago and like

I said it's not the worst thing in the

world since it's functional it works

it's sometimes rewarding but it just

seems so uninspired and lazy when you

have an innovative game like Red Dead 2

and you tack on the exact same formula

it from over a decade ago with no

changes whatsoever to the combat but I

mean like I said it's functional gets

the job done you still shoot people and

throw knives at people the same way you

did eight fucking years ago exactly the

same way now those are the only real

complaints I have they're kind of big

complaints I feel like it really hinders

the game overall and prevents it from

being this magnum opus of gaming that

everyone seems to give it credit for I

don't think it deserves that merit that

title it is an extremely impressed

of game and I didn't even touch on

everything it'd be a fucking 30 minute

video to talk about all the good shit in

this game because there's so much to

this game I didn't even touch on the

minigames or the fucking poker that I

played for three hours I played fucking

three hours of poker in one sitting I

just got so involved with the characters

I was competing against there's just a

lot in this game and it most of it the

majority of it is extremely good but

there are a lot of glaring issues with

the title so let's just go ahead and

plug this shit into the moist meter I'm

giving red dead redemption to an 80 and

then everyone all at once in the gaming

community the comments section the our

gaming subreddit collectively just shit

their pants grab their pitchforks and

told their parents that I'm an evil man

who gave the Red Dead Redemption to

below a ninety and a hundred goddamn but

I'm like I said this is an incredible

game that happens to unfortunately be

bogged down by some huge missteps but

again overall I think the game is

amazing from the technical side of

things it's fucking awe-inspiring what

they've been able to do and I think I'd

absolutely recommend this game to most

people that would enjoy some good

writing and some good characters a great

world to experience with a lot of shit

to do inside of it so I mean yeah that's

it

so yeah

Moist Meter | Castlevania

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're looking at the

Castlevania Netflix series which is a

series that had no right being as good

as it turned out to be this shit had all

of the makings of a greedy cash grab a

soulless passionless project for example

like taking Avatar The Last Airbender

and making it live action just taking

the biggest fattest stinkiest diarrhea

shit all over the legacy of it that's

what this sounded like it was quietly

announced in 2017 no one really had many

expectations going into it and season

one turned out to be fucking great and

in season two just released and I think

it's equally as good but it has a lot

more problems the first of which being

the number of episodes season one has

four episodes but it felt huge it felt

like a lot went into them season two has

eight episodes and some of the episodes

feel entirely pointless and filled with

just dialogue to pad for time my guess

is they had around the same budget for

season two of season 1 but Netflix

wanted eight episodes instead of four so

they had to stretch it out artificially

so you get some weird dialogue and some

odd pacing but that's not too big of an

issue because everything else kind of

makes up for it Castlevania has a really

compelling story and characters an

interesting plot it takes Dracula it

takes the evil and it humanizes it and

you can almost feel for them in the

cause and all of the characters are

really interesting and well-thought-out

characters except for a couple who are

just comically evil like a bad vampire

Viking who's just this naughty bad guy

who likes to think about titties and

fuck ass with his penis and kill things

and drink blood but other than that all

the characters they're very interesting

well-rounded and they have sad

backstories and the show gets really

dark the show gets really gritty and

paints Humanity in a very negative light

it's not a happy show but sometimes they

try and ham fist happy jokes into it

which really just doesn't fit the

overall tone like I said I feel like it

just pads for time with some stilted

dialogue but I like that it gets that

dark and it gets super violent and gory

you'll have people's skin being melted

off and being flayed alive heads flying

all over the place and go

galore it's it's different it reminds me

of like the late 80s Early 90s wave of

anime where everything was ultraviolent

everything was shockingly edgy but in a

good way

like you know edgy has this connotation

where it's always negative

oh it's edgy ooh I'm gonna stay away

from that but sometimes edginess can be

super fucking fun to watch and I think

Castlevania it's in this case is good

it's good edginess and I do think there

is edginess for the sake of it but it

fits the show's tone well and the

animation in this show is second to none

this is by far the best american-made

animation since The Last Airbender I

can't think of anything else that even

comes close it's so smooth it's so

fucking crisp and it's a lovely to look

at beautiful at times but there is an

issue I have and it's during the fights

sometimes it just gets really choppy as

if it's like a bad connection and an

online FPS it starts like lag so you'll

have Belmont throwing a punch and then

it starts like slow down as it's about

to make impact and then it makes impact

and then all of a sudden it jumps frames

and now the things flying across the

room like it feels like you were

watching a PowerPoint presentation but

some of the slides in between we're

missing so then you just left to kind of

fill in the details in your head and it

doesn't happen with every fight but

towards the end of the show it starts to

really show it gets really choppy during

some of the action which is very odd and

I do think it just comes down to well

they had to stretch it out for eight

episodes this time instead of four so

that couldn't really focus too much on

that and make it as smooth as it was in

season one also another thing during the

fights the sound is super off you'll

have someone getting hit with a sword

and it sounds like someone just shot a

spit ball at them the sound just doesn't

match up with the actions you're seeing

so you'll have a guy throwing a punch

and getting hit and it sounds like

someone took a wiffle ball bat to a rock

outside it's just weird and it's jarring

and you'll notice it for sure but that's

like my only big complaint it's the only

one that I can really think of the show

it's super fucking good I honestly can't

stress enough how much I like the fight

scenes in this show

they're so beautifully animated one

except for when it gets choppy into

their super different they seem like

super well choreographed one of my big

problems with like anime fights and

cartoon fights is

always kind of the same formulaic shit

here's my big move and then villain

here's my big move

oh we clashed here's a bigger move

here's a bigger move we clashed again

but I have the biggest move i beaten the

villain and the fight lasts all of like

two minutes and in between there's

always this talking like they'll throw a

move and then stop the talk and like

have some idle chitchat about tinder

dates or some shit during the fight or

the power of friendship and then they'll

get back to it for another ten seconds

Castlevania just gives you a fucking ton

of action like the fight at the end with

Dracula is so great and so well

choreographed it's not just like the

standard here's a spell here's a spell

let's talk it's let's just fucking

pummel each other in cool ways dodging

moves doing some cool fucking wing Jun

moves on them occasionally it's fucking

great

I love the fights in this show let's

plug this shit into the moist meter I'm

giving the Castlevania series an 85

percent I think if season 2 was less

episodes 4 or 5 like season 1 where it

could be more focused more smooth I

think it would have been even better and

could have got rid of all the filler and

shit but it's still a fantastic fucking

show even if you're not a fan of the

Castlevania series so yeah

Moist Meter | Overlord

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter Overlord is an anime that's been

recommended to me so many times I

expected it to be some type of divine

show like the fucking Jehovah's

Witnesses kept banging on my door

promoting Overlord to me this show was

so hyped up I expected it to put inches

on my penis

and give me the winning lottery numbers

and after finishing all three seasons I

binge them I can safely say it was good

but it's nothing super special or

anything following in the recent trend

in anime where every anime has to take

place inside of a video game this show

takes place inside of a video game kind

of so there's a power player in a very

popular dive MMO that is giving one last

hoorah before the game goes offline

they're shutting down the servers and he

decides to go back then in jerk off one

final time because he spent so long on

the game and he's so powerful part of

the best fucking guild so as a server

shutdown he's still in servers go off

and then he immediately gets transported

to the real-world variation of the game

and he becomes his character so it's a

little different than sorta art online

where the people are still in the real

world that you've stuck in a video game

here he gets transported to an actual

real unfamiliar world but as his

character and his guild comes with him

and they're all real now too

it's not a unique story but it's a fun

one and I think it's executed well I

enjoy the characters I enjoy the story

but the show has so many fucking

problems the biggest being laughably bad

CGI the CGI and this show is so fucking

bad it makes Jimmy Neutron look new and

innovative in the 3d Department it means

somehow the CGI in this show is worse

than Beast Wars and Jimmy Neutron both

of which came out in the early 2000s

it's laughably bad insufferably bad and

it's used so frequently every single

fight in so many other scenes that

aren't even fights are relying on CGI I

know why because budget constraints but

man it's jarring and bad any time anime

uses CGI it's always a disaster and this

show uses it fucking frequently and

another thing that shows how low the

budget for this must be is the fight

scenes because nine times out of ten

if you're watching a fight scene like in

the middle of it it'll pan out of the

fight and just show you the moon or some

fat guys asshole off to the side or

something anything to take you away from

the action which would cost money to

animate so it shows something else and

then you just hear the action you hear

swords clashing blood spilling come

flying and then it'll pan back after the

fight and then you see the aftermath oh

that's fucking cool yeah I guess I'll

just use my imagination it's it's silly

it's it's really bad when there's a

fight you know you're only gonna get

like three seconds of the fight and then

you're just gonna be looking at the sand

or the grass and then you'll get to see

the aftermath it's boring

it's really boring and it's a shame

because there's so much they could do

with the fights and this and sometimes

there are fights that aren't Panda way

or CGI'd and when that happens it's nice

it's refreshing it's cool but that's

super rare nine times out of ten you're

getting bad CGI with fucking claymation

figures falling away and then you're

gonna get Panda way action and you'll

hear the fights that's about it but I

mean that's a huge huge negative when

the show is about this really fucking

powerful guy with some really cool

spells powers and subordinates rampaging

and taking over the world you've got to

have some flashy shit go on and that

just does not happen in the show at all

but that's still a good show it's fun to

see how he goes about taking over

certain places how he plans to rule them

and also how far he's fallen from being

a human he truly has no humanity left in

him he has become his character the

Overlord and it's it's nice and all I

think all of the characters are pretty

strong say for a couple shitty ones are

some there's some shit ease in here but

overall they're pretty fleshed out and

fun to watch them scheme and interact

and shit like that

another huge shortcoming of this show is

for some reason it has this incessant

need to focus on the most boring aspects

of the universe for example in season 2

like the first five episodes are about a

lizard man tribe who gives a fuck about

the lizard man tribe they don't do

anything interesting it's just hey we're

lizard men there's five different tribes

of lizard men well let's unite the

tribes of lizard men all right let's go

do that all right good good shit lizard

men and it leads up to ions coming in

and just saying hey I'm gonna conquer

the lizard man they're like

you conquered us the lizard men submit

who wants to fought watch five episodes

of this shit maybe like two episodes of

the lizard men assembling and trying to

unite against ions and then failing but

stretching it out over like five

episodes man it was tiresome to watch

what a fucking Shore and it's not just

the lizard man Ark if you want to call

it that more like the lizard man fart

but season three had the same thing

where it focused on some really trivial

situations and characters you just

didn't care about it just seems like it

was padding for episodes I don't I don't

understand why they focused on those

things instead of the actual fun shit

which is ions trying to get his name out

there and take over and also the other

interesting characters and other

portions of the world but instead they

focus on the boringest one it's just

missed it's just missed the mark there

big-time those episodes were a goddamn

Schlag so let's just go ahead and plug

the shit into the moist meter I'm giving

Overlord a 65 percent it's a show I

would still recommend especially for

those fans of like the video game

setting shit because it's a lot of fun

when ions is using these incredible

spells and then it gets super anime

anime cliche where as enemies they're

like oh my god that's 50th tier magic

thought only to be used by Jesus Christ

himself I cannot believe what I am

seeing in front of my eyes right now the

power of friendship it did spoiling us

it's fun it's really fucking goofy fun

and when the fights are actually

animated not in CGI and not panned away

the fights are fucking cool this spells

being cast at each other and then the

occasional sword fights it's nice to

watch that shit go down and then it's

got like the standard video game shit

which is kind of cool to see come alive

overall it's a good show but man it has

so many fucking shortcomings and I think

it could be so much better if its budget

was a little higher or if they knew what

to really put in the episodes and focus

on and not draw boring shit out but I

mean yeah I mean it's a show I'd

recommend just a lot of unrealized

potential

so yeah

Moist Meter | Attack on Titan

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter it's me the avatar of Greece the

unshowered specimen of pure filth over

24 hours without a shower feeling real

stinky delivering another anime moist

meter this time for attack on Titan

season 3 just ended so I figured I'd do

a moist meter for the whole show I think

attack on Titan is a must-see anime even

if you don't like anime or even cartoons

I remember when the first season came

out back in college my roommates who

never watched anime they're way too cool

you know I like football I prefer the

pigskin not these fucking titties

cartoon 2d stuff then I'd come into the

room and there fucking watching attack

on Titan embarrass about it yeah bro I

was just I was just flipping through the

anime calm fucking weirdos making fun of

them but what I'm not saying is it was a

show that captured the audience that

isn't just anime lovers it was a shit it

was a season that was so good

that the general populace really got

drawn in for a good reason because it's

almost a masterpiece there's a lot of

low points in season 1 in my opinion but

it's super fucking good the animation

and attack on Titan seasons 1 2 & 3 is a

fucking stellar outstanding the action

scenes are the most stylish and

beautiful and all of the currently

airing anime the animation is just

leagues above others and that's my

biggest biggest compliment to the show

it's so fucking great when you get this

high octane you know fucking spider

Manning around to these naked giants and

then slashing their necks it's so

fucking fun to watch and on top of that

the show has a fucking an interesting

story to tell a really interesting story

to tell

it doesn't always tell it very well but

the story is good enough and there do a

good enough job that keeps me fucking

scratching at my neck like a meth addict

going through a trawl it's waiting for

more answers to the questions it

proposes you always want to learn more

about the universe and attack on Titan

and about the characters I don't think

all the characters are that great

I even think the main character Eren

Jaeger is a bit underwhelming he does a

lot of sulking and you know self-pity

fuck my dick so small I have to keep the

lights off because girls will laugh at

it I'm just not good enough I was I

chose I'm not worthy

and then I'd like a Eureka moment and

get inspired it's 3.5 inches of steel

and bravery it's enough penis for any

girl I am the one I can do this and then

he goes and does his job there's a lot

of that and I don't care for that that

much so I think he's not a super great

character overall but there are a lot of

good characters in here I think Captain

Levi for example is a fucking great

character well-rounded super fun to

watch it's a really good show overall

and a lot of those you know pinky out

anime puritan nerd you know soft dick

and hand nerds look like to criticize

attack on Titan and think anyone that

likes it is some type of cro-magnon who

has poor taste but I don't understand

why the show is just really good even if

you don't like anime it's a really good

show even if you don't like a good story

the action is really good and worth it

to sit through the story now that being

said there is a lot of exposition in the

episodes and that's kind of a negative

even though I love the story it's a bit

of a negative because season 3 for

example the one that just wrapped up

there was so few action scenes in here

was almost insulting it seemed like it

kind of forgot what kind of show it was

there's entire episodes where it takes

place and then like three rooms total

just talking back and forth it's not

exactly filler because you learn very

important details about the characters

or the story but it's not super fun to

watch either you're just being lectured

it's like you're sitting in a college

classroom learning about like micro bio

or something and that's not to say I

think season 3 is bad by any means cuz I

did enjoy it but when you look back on

season 1 which had the perfect balance

of a lot of really incredible

jaw-dropping action and story and then

you look at season 3 where it's it seems

like they ran out of money and could

only animate standing still but if you

know face scenes and mouth movements

it's sad because you want more action

and there is some and when it's there in

season 3 it's still really good but you

always want more you want story with the

action that's that's what the show was

built on that's why season 1 was such a

huge success in every part of the world

that's why so many people that don't

even like anime fell in love with it it

is just really fucking fun but it's not

fun to watch the characters you stand in

a fucking football huddle you know

divulging information to each other

that's kind of boring to watch and it's

a bunch of flashbacks which also are not

that fun to watch season 2 also kind of

fell victim to that not as badly

I thought season 2 is pretty strong even

though a lot of people disagreed I

thought it built up to something really

big and then that something really big

happened at the end and it was very

worth it season three felt like it was

building up to something really big and

then it just ended it ended on a very

slow episode it ended on a cliffhanger

at the end of the episode which was kind

of just upsetting because why I hate

that kind of shit when you leave a

cliffhanger like that especially on the

back of a boring episode that's just

kind of a slap in the face

but and I understand why because they

divided the season in half it's coming

back in six months I get it I get it's

not the end of season three it's he's in

three point five coming up but still why

it's just not a very interesting way of

concluding season three and a lot of

season three was just not that fun to

watch the story's great though so

learning more about it's always nice but

there had to be a better way of going

about that instead of animating full

episodes where nothing fucking happens

except talking but overall I think

attack on Titan is an absolute must see

it does a perfect balance of despair and

hope you get to see some really you know

horrific things and you get to see some

really impressive reactions from the

characters that seems so lifelike the

facial expressions the voice acting all

of it really sells the emotion of the

show and makes it a very dark and sad

story and a very interesting one at that

and the action I can't express enough

how much fun it is to watch the action

in here and it's so beautifully animated

this sound the music the soundtrack so

fucking good iconic even so let's just

go ahead and plug this shit into the

moist meter I'm giving attack on Titan

as a whole and 85% I think it's a

must-see and I really wish seasons two

and three took some notes from the first

season which was executed so well

because it seasons two and three when my

opinion just weren't even close to as

good they're still good I still enjoyed

them but they just they couldn't hold a

candle the season one the beauty of it

the grand scale of things all the fun of

it but it is still absolutely worth

watching and I think the next season of

attack on Titan 2.5 of season 3 is going

to be fucking amazing because they've

hyped it up for

thirteen episodes worth in this you know

pseudo season so it's gotta be a huge

payoff I would hope so I'm excited for

that and I absolutely think attack on

Titan is a show you need to watch if you

like anime and even if you don't because

it's really fucking good

so yeah

Moist Meter | Halloween

this episode of the moist meter was

brought to you by honey

welcome to the moist meter today we're

looking at the new Halloween movie as it

gets closer to Halloween we've been

blessed with some extremely scary

content from the internet from shitty

youtubers left and right but now we get

graced by some Hollywood horror by a

little soft reboot of the beloved

Halloween franchise I went to this not

expecting much but I'm a huge fan of

slasher films and I was pleasantly

surprised by how great of a slasher this

movie is it's a lot of fucking fun and

one thing I want to say right away John

Carpenter who did this score for this

absolutely fuckin kill that's got the

iconic Halloween soundtrack and it's got

a lot of other great shit here it's

fucking great the score this is fucking

great carpenter annihilate it it got me

hard as a fucking rock the movie overall

it's just really good really fucking

well done Michael Myers is terrifying as

ever he's just like a fucking

Frankenstein's monster you can't move

fat past like one speed which is a

menacing walk it moves slow as a

motherfucker just moves around like an

extremely drunk man trying to pass a

field sobriety test in front of a police

officer but not doing a great job of

holding it together but somehow it

always works for Michael Myers because

he's always positioned perfectly to not

be seen and be able to strike optimally

so the the man's fuckin omniscient and

it's really fuckin cool to watch unfold

there's a lot of kills in this movie a

lot of creative kills as well I know in

slasher movies at least old-school ones

there's not like a whole ton of kills

there's just big ones that have like a

huge impact this one's just got a lot of

kills for the sake of kill is like it

was just burglar burglarize being the

wrong word cuz in them take anything

except to life but he'll go into a house

and just stab someone and leave he does

like trick-or-treating but with souls

and it's cool absolutely cool but it is

really just you know kills for the sake

of kills it doesn't really do much to

further Michael Myers you're already

afraid of the guys like a being of pure

evil they don't need to just have him

knocking on doors like a Jehovah's

Witness with a knife but it's it's still

fun to watch it unfold and it's really

fuckin cool having this dining

between Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael

Myers where she's got a fucking execute

him and Michael Myers he's well he just

exists is like a killing machine you

don't know if he really even gives a

fuck about Laurie who's Jamie Lee Curtis

his character cuz he doesn't say

anything which is really fucking cool I

thought they'd absolutely blow the load

here and have Michael Myers talk but he

doesn't and I'm glad they didn't so

you've got Jamie Lee Curtis and then

Michael Myers who God knows what the

fuck goes on and what his motivation is

and Jamie Lee Curtis is his paranoid

survivor of his and she just he has one

purpose in life which is to kill him so

she's raised her daughter to be just

like an assassin as well and her

daughter resents her for it all the

characters in here fucking great in my

opinion the only character that I'm not

a hundred percent you know go team on

was Karen who was the daughter of Jamie

Lee Curtis I thought she was just kind

of a boring character who didn't really

bring much to the table it seemed like

kind of a phoned-in performance she had

one cool scene where she fires one

bullet and that's about it but other

than that she doesn't really contribute

much and she doesn't really seem to give

much of a shit about the whole situation

but overall the movie is really well

done

it really is there's some really fucking

cool scenes here very well shot the

framing on some of them is something I

took big notice on because I really

liked how you'd have to guess where

Michael Myers was in the vicinity

because you knew he's not gonna be like

fucking hiding under the bed or

something because the man can only stand

up straight like a fucking corpse that's

somehow standing up straight so you're

always guessing where the fuck is he

standing what is he doing but there are

a few complaints I have about this movie

and they mainly revolve around horror

cliches which is stupid characters Jamie

Lee Curtis for the most part is a very

smart competent character making smart

decisions but until the end of the movie

then she makes the stupidest fucking

decisions I've seen in a while so not to

spoil anything but she's like a doomsday

prepper prepping for the Michael Myers

nuke that she believes will inevitably

occur and it does and she's created like

an underground bunker well spoiler alert

you see in the trailer so don't worry

it's not that big of a spoiler Michael

Myers comes knocking on her door and

they're hiding in the bunker and Jamie

Lee Curtis his plan is to start shooting

him through the bunker so that way he

knows where they are and then she starts

yelling at him from down there like what

the fuck was her plan all she did was

give away the position where

where she's hiding her daughter also

when she's hunting Michael Myers in the

house she has a weapon a good weapon and

then she's looking around for him and

she has good ideas of where he is like

she'll find a closet with like blood on

it because he was bleeding and instead

of just firing a bullet at the closet

just to be safe

she'll walk over to the closet get as

close as possible enough to like sniff

Michael Myers his videos there instead

of just firing a fucking bullet at it

why she just gets him melee range for no

reason Oh Michael Myers are you in there

all right I'm gonna check I'm coming in

there if you're in there I'm gonna be

right at your dick level here for a

blowjob just to make sure you're really

there make sure it's really you

it doesn't make any sense I don't know

why she wouldn't play that more

cautiously and fire a bullet at where

she thinks he is it was just silly

decisions like that but overall most of

the characters made competent choices

which is good it's nice to see in the

modern horror movie because it's pretty

rare but until the 8th starts to fall

apart at the end there I don't have any

like huge complaints about this movie I

don't think it's the best slasher ever

made I don't even think it's the best

modern slasher that's ever been made but

it is a very well-done

competent modern slasher that does

Michael Myers justice there's some goofy

scenes like in the beginning where one

of the investigative journalists shows

Michael Myers the mask and then all the

crazy people are going crazy oh I got

some goofy shit there's some goofy

scenes here and there but overall it

really is a competent slasher so let's

plug the shit into the moist meter I'm

giving the new Halloween and 80% the

movies fucking good it's not a

masterpiece of slasher cinema or

anything like that but it's really well

done and in an age of modern reboots of

beloved franchises that completely shit

on the franchise this one's pretty

goddamn faithful and it does a great job

of bringing Michael Myers back to the

forefront of horror slashing shit

so that's fuckin good definitely worth

seeing just like honey is definitely

Moist Meter | Black Ops 4

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter Call of Duty is a franchise name

that's been inducing vomit in the mouths

of men and women everywhere for the

better part of the last decade the games

they've been pumping out have just been

absolute dogshit truly atrocious however

kids still very much enjoy them they

still sing kids to bed with wet dreams

with them imagining the next Call of

Duty title and then those parents of

those children have nightmares about all

the money they lose when it comes out so

they've been financially successful they

still do really well so they keep

pumping that shit out I wasn't excited

for the newest one which is black ops 4

until I played the beta for its battle

royale mode and was blown away but how

is the full releases the full release

good is it worth it yeah it's pretty

fucking good and the best part about

black ops 4 is they just got rid of the

campaign some brave hero some brave

warrior stood up in the Activision

headquarters and said you know what

enough is enough our campaigns suck

asshole why are we doing this no one

likes them and then they all applauded

and said you know what Harrison's right

we're getting rid of this shit the Call

of Duty campaigns have been a joke for

the last eight years a fucking horrible

joke a b-movie joke a tommy wiseau joke

a fucking joke that they got tired of

telling eventually I said you know what

we're tired of telling the same jokes

get rid of it and I'm so happy they did

because this game is so much better

because it doesn't have a bad campaign

tacked on so black ops 4 only has the

multiplayer game modes it has zombies

boundary L which is the blackout mode

and then the standard multiplayer

everyone's used to zombies is great they

made some questionable decisions like

removing juggernaut but overall it's

still a very good zombie experience that

you've come to know and love from

Treyarch really well done and I have no

complaints there except for maybe taking

out a couple of things that I don't

quite understand the reason for the

multiplayer which is the standard

competitive multiplayer you used to from

cod franchise is good I'm not personally

a huge fan of the formula but it's

functional it works well it does what it

aims to do it's like a condom you know

what you're getting when you put it on

and it's just it's safe there's nothing

that's gonna blow you away there's

nothing that's gonna have your jaw on

the floor with your testicles right next

to it by how good it is but it's it's

safe it's normal it's what you'd expect

so there's

no complaints there for me either it's

not personally my taste but I can

recognize it is objectively

well-executed it's clean the biggest

complaint with multiplayer is the spawns

the spawns are objectively awful I've

seen three play the games where a guy

gets a kill dies and then gets another

kill or a kill after that so he was able

to die and spawn next to enemies that's

a clear problem with the spawning system

that shit needs to be reworked you can't

be having an elite gaming specimen

spawning next to some Boy Scouts that

didn't even expect them there so it's a

little broken with the spawns but

everything else is pretty clean now the

biggest thing with black ops 4 is its

battle royale mode black out that is

what I was most excited for after

playing the beta and it almost hurts me

to say but the game's battle royale is

just so fucking good I've never enjoyed

Call of Duty quite like I have the last

week or so of me playing this one it's

just so fucking fun the blackout mode is

excellent absolutely excellent now let

me talk about the problems I have with

the mode though because there are some

shortcomings this sound the sound and

blackout is horrible

it's deceptive you have no idea where

shots are coming from it'll sound like

there's a guy shooting in the bathroom

right next to you in the house but it

turns out that guy was shooting across

the map at a helicopter the sound echoes

everywhere and you can never deduce the

genesis of where the sound is you can

never tell where it's coming from it's

like you're stuck in like a fucking echo

chamber and you just can't figure out

where it is it's really frustrating

trying to use sound to pinpoint enemies

it's very inaccurate so that's my

biggest complaint with it another

problem I have is I think the map

doesn't lend itself very well to that

how fast-paced that and the gunplay is

because it's very hard to find enemies

there's so much foliage so many trees

and there's not a lot of verticality so

everything's flat it makes it very hard

to find enemies the map isn't that big

which is good but the map is so

cluttered that you will never find

enemies efficiently the most kills

you'll have in a game is anywhere from

three to maybe ten if you have a really

good round my personal best

unfortunately is only eight which isn't

super high but it's not bad that's not

bad but you know in a game like

fortnight you have the building to

compensate for the map size so you can

build get

VantagePoint and find people blackout

you don't have that so you just have to

find people on a level playing field

most of the time and that's really hard

but for some people that's probably a

plus a lot of people may like this

slower pace and the lack of finding

enemies but me I like the faster pace

games so that's a negative in my book

now it's gonna be hard to talk about

blackout without it being compared to

fortnight so I'll compare it to

fortnight I think fortnight is a battle

but a better battle royale game for one

simple fact

you can always fight back the

positioning let's say someone is camping

near a tree that you don't see because

you're playing fast-paced and they see

you first

in fortnight you get shot at you build

you can react you can fight back you can

outplay them you're never idle you're

never going to guarantee a loss by

getting out positioned or because you're

at a disadvantage in blackout if someone

has a better position and sees you first

you're pretty much fucked I mean that is

of course unless the guy that spots you

has got his soft cock in his hands with

his eyes closed shooting at you but the

majority of the time if someone sees you

first and you don't see them there is no

chance of you winning that encounter and

I think just for that one simple

difference between blackout and

fortnight where fortnight has a mechanic

that allows you to fight back even at a

disadvantage and blackout does not it

doesn't have anything for you to fight

back with it just leaves you out there

with your asshole out in the open

exposed and shit so for me personally I

like the fact that you can always fight

back in fortnight regardless of the

situation and black out doesn't have

that so I think fortnight is the better

battle royale just for that one simple

fact where if you get good at building

you can always always always react and

have a chance which I always enjoy so I

do think fortnight's the better Battle

Royale but I think blackout is the

second best battle royale by a wide

margin I think it is just barely worse

than fortnight because there just one

simple difference between them but it is

so fucking good that I can't recommend

it enough it is so much fun I've been

having a whole lot of fun with black ops

4 which I didn't expect I didn't expect

expect I never liked Call of Duty again

because they've been so uninspired and

shitty but this is just so good let's

blow this shit into the moist meter I'm

giving black ops for an 85-percent it is

just really good I

so few complaints about it and the

complaints that I do have aren't game

changing it's just there's simple things

that should be tweaked and fixed that I

think would make this an even better

experience but right now this is

probably the best multiplayer game

that's on the market that's not

free-to-play it's probably the best

retail triple-a game out there at the

moment if you're into multiplayer games

and shooters it's definitely worth

picking up it's a lot of fucking fun so

yeah

Moist Meter | Bad Times at the El Royale

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're looking at bad times

at the El Royale this is a movie I was

pretty excited to see and his Andrew put

it it's seven strangers stuck in a fuck

house and that's exactly what the movie

turned out to be it advertises seven

strangers seven secrets but how good is

the movie how fucking what is it let's

get into it so seven strangers seven

secrets it's not entirely accurate yeah

some of them have some secrets but as

the movie continues to progress I feel

like they forgot that they're supposed

to have secrets because then a couple of

them just get super trivial like oh this

girl's left foots a little longer than

her right foot shocking this other

character left a ten percent tip instead

of the standard 15 percent tip at the

diner she went to before she arrived at

the El Royale

they just dumb little secrets as it

continues to progress but that's not a

huge complaint because I don't think the

secrets really mattered they were there

to set up a really interesting plot and

it's not a plot without holes there's a

lot of fucking holes in the plot but

that doesn't change how unique it was or

how it was delivered it was really nice

seeing the plot unfolds from a bunch of

different perspectives a lot of times

what'll happen is it's divided into

rooms for each stranger so you'll get

one perspective from one character and

then when something happens it'll have

like a little fucking checkpoint like in

a video game and then it'll rewind the

scene and you see the same kind of shit

the same time period unfold from a

different characters perspective and I

like that I really enjoyed that I

thought that was a very fun way of

presenting the narrative and the acting

here was fucking phenomenal the guy who

played Myles blew it out of the fucking

park I don't know who that guy was but

if he's not nominated for ten Grammys

and an Oscar it's doing the world of

great to service I know Grammys for

music but god damn it this guy was just

super good he deserves all the awards

hats off to you Myles if you're watching

this 100% of the moist meter for your

performance overall though every

character perform great especially Jeff

Bridges and Myles I was expecting much

more of a mystery and slow-burn kind of

movie where a lot of different shit gets

thrown at you and it's really

off-the-wall

that's not exactly what you get with

it's all pretty straightforward and

spoon-fed to you which isn't necessarily

a bad thing but definitely not what I

was expecting it has a very interesting

plot up until the end then it kind of

just becomes like this pretty standard

crime drama movie and there's really not

like a whole lot of emotion or anything

super powerful or moving it doesn't

really utilize the unique narrative and

setting that it sets up in the beginning

it kind of just becomes this generic

crime drama flick and that's

disappointing but it's still really good

at a crime drama movie and it has the

nice kicker of having a great fucking

set up and with some great

cinematography to add that nice little

semen droplet on the top of this

beautiful fucking cake that I think most

of you should want to eat I think it's a

good movie like I said it's got great

direction but maybe the last 30 maybe

even 40 minutes it just kind of becomes

a pretty generic and predictable crime

drama movie a bit of a letdown but it's

still good at being a crime drama movie

so let's go ahead and plug this bitch

into the moist meter giving bad times at

the El Royale and 80% I think I

definitely think they could have done a

lot more with the latter half of this

movie but still very good and I really

enjoyed it it's a fucking good movie so

yeah

Moist Meter | Steins;Gate 0

initiating moisture today the mega meaty

men man scientists found within moist

meter laboratories go where no

scientists have ever dared go before and

have taken the moist meter where no man

woman nor beast thought possible we're

taking the moist meter to the incredible

wonderful world of big-tittied anime

goth girlfriends anime today we're gonna

be looking at steins gate zero i'm a

huge fucking stein skate fan I loved the

anime and I even played the the game

back when I was on the Xbox 360 arcade I

thought it was gonna be like one of

those hint eye games where there's like

a lot of vagina and ass and stuff so I

played the game with my dick in my hand

but by the time I finished the game I

had my heart in my hand my dick in my

heart it was such a goddamn great game

and the anime was just as good and I was

super excited for steins gate zero and

I'm super happy to say steins gate zero

is fucking great - I don't think it's

better than steins gate but I think it

is very very good still on the same

level it earns the right to be called

steins gate with a zero at the end of it

now this story takes place where steins

gate kind of right before it ended where

the world the timeline gets divided

Okabe after failing to save everyone in

reach steins gate does not try again and

he throws in the towel that's the

timeline where this one takes place the

beta one and it's a really dark timeline

and I know kind of saying that's a

little bit of a spoiler for some people

but you can't watch steins gate 0 if you

haven't seen steins gate it's not worth

it you're not going to understand

anything in steins gate 0 that happens

because they don't explain shit

they expect you to know everything they

expect you to pass the test on steins

gate lore at the end of the fucking show

you have to watch steins gate 0 having

freshly watched steins gate and have

like the goddamn um the crown of steins

gate lore open in front of you to piece

together everything that happens in the

first 10 episodes of the sequel here

which isn't really a sequel but anyway

it takes place in a darker time line

which is the beta one and it really

isn't afraid to get dark there's a lot

of stuff in here where it's

very you know it's sad there's nothing

overly dark it's not like there's

someone who snaps a dog's neck drinks

its blood and then pees on an innocent

old man or anything there's nothing like

shockingly dark or weird but they're

just toys with some really dark themes

such as how many times can you fail and

see something horrific before it breaks

you and you give up and just a lot of

things mainly circling around despair

and throwing in the towel and I like

that they play with that it's nothing

new but I think steins gate zero does it

really well and that gives you nothing

but likeable characters there's no

characters in this show that I think

aren't good or at least well-rounded I

think they are all interesting except

for one there's one professor I don't

want to spoil anything but she's a very

two-dimensional flat fucking bored of a

character that is really only there to

be like a caricature of a bad villain

like a James Bond or like even Austin

Powers level villain type deal so I

thought she was kind of weak but other

than that it's nothing but great

characters across the board and it's

visually it's fucking great I love the

visuals in steins gate I'm a huge fan of

the whole theme of time traveling and

they play with it really well now let me

talk about some of the cons and there

are quite a few that I'd like to talk

about the first 10 or so episodes are

extremely convoluted there's so many

moving parts here and so much going on

and that you kind of expect it with time

travel because everything gets messy

there but here it's it's overwhelmingly

so so much so where you're gonna start

like you're gonna go to a fucking

whiteboard and start writing down notes

and then connecting arrows and shit and

it just gets hard to follow and you get

lost

which isn't really a positive it all

starts to piece itself together and wrap

itself up for a really satisfying

conclusion at the end but getting there

is it's a fucking mind-boggling ride and

not a very good way another thing that I

want to point out is these people

fucking love the party in this show they

throw a party every two episodes they've

party anytime one of them farts they

celebrate there's a lot of fucking

parties in here I'm not talking frat

parties I'm talking like your mom and

her friends book book club level parties

where there's little herbs and shit very

tame parties nothing wild no one

twirling bras over their heads and going

wild and peeing on tables but that's not

a complaint that's or something I

thought I'd point out the only main

complaint I have is that

convoluted storyline and the only other

complaint past that is the action is

really it's bad but when there's an

action scene with guns or fighting it's

laughable it's like a YouTube animation

I don't know what happened there but it

doesn't seem like they had much of a

budget to pull off action shots cuz it's

clunky there's there's a lot of a lot of

shit wrong with the action but it's not

like this shows about blood titties and

rock and roll it's not that kind of

anime so it's not a whole lot of action

here in the first place but when it is

here it's it's just not good but I just

don't have a whole lot of complaints

about this show I really don't I think

it's a very fuckin good anime but it's

something you should never watch unless

you've seen steins gate recently because

you're gonna need to brush up on your

fucking information to keep up it's

really it's worth it though if you've

seen steins gate definitely gotta see

steins gate zero it's it didn't

disappoint not at all

let's plug this shit into the moist

meter I'm giving steins gate zero fat

fucking eighty percent cuz it's fucking

great it is a really good show with some

shortcomings unfortunately like I

mentioned I feel like they could have

done better with laying out the plot in

the beginning so it didn't confuse the

shit out of anyone who watches it but

other than that and the action obviously

other than that though it's it's really

good it's it's a watertight fun plot and

I love the way that they reintroduce

characters and then at the end you know

towards the end they start to piece

together everything that happens in

steins gate plus throughout steins gate

zero it's just it's fucking great and

then I can't recommend it enough if

you've already seen steins gate and if

you haven't definitely checked that out

and then steins gate co it's fucking

good see ya

Moist Meter | Hell Fest

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today let's take a look at my

butthole and then also talk about how

fast how fast is a new movie that came

out today about well you know Hellfest

which is Halloween Horror Nights on the

big screen basically it's just those

haunted houses at theme parks that's the

whole movie I actually think the setting

is pretty interesting as Halloween rolls

closer I decide you know what let's make

this a spooky episode of the moist meter

didn't do this in Reverse

I'm giving Hellfest a 40% on the moist

meter that's right I just fucking

whipped out my dick flopped out on you

chin and gave you the moist meter rating

right in the beginning of the video you

can turn it off now if you're satisfied

with knowing what my score is but do you

want justification I don't think you

really give a shit you probably don't

mean know what how fast is there wasn't

a lot of marketing budget behind this

bad boy but I was surprised I expected

this movie to be a pile of dog shit and

while it wasn't anything great it was a

pretty competent slasher movie the

characters were annoying but one of the

characters played a really good awkward

guy so I respected the shit out of that

he actually seemed like a super awkward

guy that they hired for this but he's a

good looking dude so I'm sure he's not

that socially inept in the real world he

could probably blow a fucking raspberry

and get pussy as a result of it but he

played a great awkward character so at

how fast the Halloween Horror Nights

here there's a man who goes around

killing people and no one believes it

and I thought that was really cool

because I was able to relate to that not

that I've gone around killing people at

a Halloween Horror Nights but if I saw a

murder during one of these things I

wouldn't believe it at first I think it

was part of the act I'd take it with a

grain of salt like yeah buddy I'm sure

you just killed her great acting I can

see the ketchup but in here you know

that happens on the screen you like oh

yeah that would be kind of fucked

you wouldn't even know and I thought

that was really cool it's not unique

where people in a horror movie

no one believes it like they'll witness

it and then think it's fake but here I

thought it was really clever because of

the you know it's Halloween all that

kind of shit happens as on gags and acts

so I enjoyed that like I said I don't

think the characters are very good I

think they're pretty annoying and

they're the kind of people where if you

saw them in the actual Halloween Horror

Nights setting you would hate to be

around him you would be absolutely

miserable having to be

these people in the haunted house taking

selfies with all the props and then

pointing out all the actors like a good

try buddy fuck you I'm not scared or

like making a lot of big noise and grand

gestures like a bad youtuber but as far

as throw away shitty horror movies go I

think this one's probably one of the

better ones they've come out with just

because I like the premise and I think

it's executed well the slasher the main

bad guy he's kind of cool kind of creepy

and there's some decent little jump

scares in there I suppose so I mean

overall it's a competently done slasher

movie with a lot of shit that holds it

back obviously being just very clearly a

throwaway kind of movie they didn't

expect much out of it and they're not

pretty not gonna get much out of it but

if you want to just go see something

kind of mind-numbing leave fun

I think this is probably pretty decent

one to check out so yeah

Moist Meter | The Predator

initiating moisture what the fuck is up

wet enthusiasts welcome to the moist

meter and I am beyond excited to talk

about the new predator movie this is the

best bad movie I've seen in theaters in

a very long time no matter how you look

at this movie it's super shit from its

story to its characters to just about

every component of this movie it's all

fucking bad but it is very enjoyable bad

this is probably the most fun I've had

in a movie theater in a long time the

audience was laughing at the movie and

even at times laughing with the movie

from the very first scene it looks like

you're watching like a puppet show for

some reason the whole movie looks bad

like nothing in this movie looks good

it all looks very low-budget and very

low effort and that adds to the charm of

this movie so fucking much from the

first scene you know you're in for a

catastrophic disaster of film but what

you don't know from the first scene is

how fun that ride is gonna be and let me

just go ahead and say there are this

movie doesn't work at all as an action

movie it's a super shit action movie but

it works really well as a comedy slash

kind of gory action movie they use the

let's just go ahead and explain this

there's some characters in here that are

comic relief characters and there's some

actual good comedy writing all of the

action is bad in every department there

it's a complete failure but in the

comedy side of things they do get a few

things right and they even use some of

the action for comedy and they use it

well like the physical comedy here like

a man's face getting blown off it's done

in comedic way sometimes and then

sometimes unintentionally comedic where

the predator will throw a guy pretty

lightly against the wall and then all of

a sudden his fucking arms and legs shoot

off and there's blood everywhere it's

like a fucking mr. Potato Head exploding

I don't know why everyone's so fragile

in the universe here but it seems its

points it's self-aware and it doesn't

take itself seriously and then other

times it does seem like it's taking

itself way too seriously but it doesn't

matter cuz and then neither one of it

two tracks and the dichotomy doesn't

really matter because the movie is still

so goddamn bad fun to watch holy shit

now let me go ahead and give you the

story so the predator

yeah it comes to earth he's getting

hunted by a super predator it's revealed

that the predator came to earth because

it's trying to help us I'm not trying to

give spoilers but it's really important

because I really want to I want to I

want to tell you about this this story

line here so the predator he gets hunted

by the super predator it's revealed he's

trying to help humans and what the

Predators want and that the bad

predators what they want is they want to

hybridize they want to capture strong

humans to put into their DNA and make

themselves stronger they want to evolve

they want to upgrade now the main

character son is autistic and that's not

a laughing matter anything however what

they do what the kid is just ridiculous

the Predators want to capture the kid so

that way they could absorb his autism

the Predators main goal is to capture

autism and bring it to their species

that is the whole that's the whole

driving factor to the predator species

be like if perfect cell in Dragon Ball Z

needed to reach the perfect level by

absorbing a geriatric patients dementia

that I don't understand what the the

thought process was when they wrote this

and a kid having autism that's not

anything laughable but when you make the

plot point we are going to take your

autism and infect our species with it to

evolve that's just that's just

ridiculous you can't help but laugh

about that that's so fucking insane and

that is the actual plot lines in this

movie now you're probably not gonna go

to the predator movie to really care

about the plot so that's not important

you're gonna go there for some action

blood guts and tits

there's no titties here but there are

some blood and guts and there's a little

bit action all of its done very poorly

like I said but sometimes they use that

action in a comedic way for example one

of the main antagonists ends up blowing

his head off by accident and it's good

comedic timing it's well executed

there's a scene where ki and his

counterpart in the movie they both get

badly injured and they look at each

other and they have this very masculine

stare like yeah they shake heads then

they each point a gun at each other and

shoot each other at the same time it's

it's the fucking action the comedy here

is played into the action at points it

seems I don't know if it's intentional

or not but

fuck me it was so goddamn entertaining

it was really really fun to watch this

movie it's so bad it's a really bad

movie I need to stress that but I can't

recommend this movie enough I don't

think you're gonna find another movie in

theaters right now that you're gonna

have more fun and this is just so fuckin

shitty bad like I mean I could keep

talking about why it's bad but I don't

need to all you need to know is it's bad

enough to be extremely enjoyable let's

go ahead and plug this shit into the

moist meter I'm giving the new predator

movie a 30% that's speaking objectively

going by pure entertainment it's it's a

lot higher because like I said this is

the most fun I've had in a movie theater

theater in a while but is it's an

objectively super bad movie the saving

grace of this movie is it's surprisingly

competent comedy writing and it's

actually intentional comedy writing

there's some good jokes in here and some

likeable characters but honestly see I

can't recommend this enough go see this

fucking movie because it is it's not the

room levels it's not even close to the

room or anything but this is probably

the closest we're gonna get for a little

while this shit was fucking amazingly

bad fun see ya

Moist Meter | Marvel's Spider-Man

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we'll be analyzing the

wetness found within the new spiderman

game spider-man's always been known as

the world's greatest detective and the

unstoppable incredible mr. spider-man

but how incredible is the mr. spider-man

game well that's the question we aim to

answer with the moist meter so brace

your asshole cuz I want to put my fat

dick of knowledge in it it's best part

about spider-man game as its combat

hands-down the gameplay here is

absolutely fantastic it's the same type

of free flow combat you're used to

seeing in the Arkham series except I

think it's done better in the spider-man

game and the web-swinging

is so fucking satisfying I only fast

traveled two times throughout my 20 or

so hours with the game it is just fun

going from point A to point B which is a

compliment I can't pay very many games

oftentimes it's such a fucking chore

where you know you have to very slowly

walk from point A to point B maybe you

sprint a little bit but you get winded

and you're always just looking for a

fast travel here you you look forward to

just moving around the city in a city

that feels alive there's a ton of

collectable shit here although I think

the collectable shits kind of weak like

you're looking for backpacks that's not

exactly fun I don't want to be looking

for like fucking pencil pouches in my

backpack around the city but there's a

lot to do there's random event crimes

that'll pop up that you can take part in

which is nice any excuse to get into

more combat is always welcomed in this

game and I really can't stress enough

just how flashy and fun the combat is it

never really gets boring although in the

sometimes in situations where you're

just faced with moms and moms of enemies

it does get pretty tedious and speaking

of tedious that brings me to a big

negative about the game a lot of the

missions main missions included feels so

trivial and mundane as if a schoolboy

could complete them it doesn't take a

superhero to do half the shit spider-man

does throughout like maybe the first

eight hours of the game for example one

of the side missions was analyzing water

pressure and then unclogging a pipe

that's not fun I don't need to be a

fucking super

a look at water pressure and then move

to trash bags from a pipe that's very

boring

another main mission objective example

would be like installing solar panels on

an old woman's house or delivering Girl

Scout cookies to a specific neighborhood

for 20 minutes it's just really boring

activities that you're just bogged down

with in the early game and it really

destroys the pacing and fun in my

opinion it was just such a slog and so

miserable to have to be doing such

mundane tasks around the city four main

missions and four side shit and I'm not

kidding I'm not exaggerating another one

was analyzing the air quality like come

on that's not that's not some superhero

fun shit that's like something a normal

guy with a normal job would have I'm not

playing normal guy simulator I'm playing

spider fucking man simulator and then

when you're not doing boring chores

around the city you're actually doing

some superhero action which is fun and

then that pace that momentum is

immediately killed with a mary jane

stealth mission or another stealth

mission

the stealth missions are just there's

nothing enjoyable about them there's no

there's nothing to be had there you

might as well just go to sleep during

the stealth mission you'd be having more

fun the stealth missions just feel so

out of place in this game and they add

almost nothing to it in rare occasions

during a stealth mission you'll get some

pretty interesting exposition but at the

cost of zero enjoyment at all the

stealth missions are definitely the

weakest point of the game and I'd prefer

the little boy scout checklist that you

go through in other missions where you

just do fucking dumb things around the

city but besides the lackluster missions

the stealth missions and the boring ass

chores the game is still a very fun game

to play when there's actual superhero

missions where you're actually fighting

crime piecing together a puzzle it's a

lot of fun it is a lot of fun you have

so many gadgets is at your disposal that

you can mix and match and pull off some

fun combos with you get a lot of really

fun suits with some fun suit powers that

come with mods or well they don't come

with mods but you can install mods on

them to suit your playstyle there

a lot of depth here and I was really

surprised by that and I enjoyed it and

on top of that the game has a really

impressive story to tell I didn't think

this was going to be a dart game I

thought it was just gonna be a throwaway

feel-good superhero game but I was

absolutely wrong it's very well-written

and the story it'll it'll tug on your

heartstrings it is just a good story and

it's not afraid to go dark it doesn't

pull any punches it's not putting the

condom on in some areas here and it's a

welcome change to just a very tried and

you know overdone super hero formula

another big point about this game that I

think is a positive thing is there's a

lot of content now like I said I think a

lot of the collectibles inside should

are very weak but there are some really

cool ones in there as well and just the

robustness of it because you have so

much of it all of it can't be great I

understand that but it's nice that you

have all of these things that you can do

around the city if you'd choose to do

them I respect that and it really does

add a lot to the game because there is a

lot of different side shit you're not

always doing the same ones although

they're all pretty mundane it's still a

lot to choose from and a lot to do in

the city now let's go ahead and plug

this shit into the moist meter I'm

giving the new spider-man game a 75% if

the missions kept up the way they did at

the end of the game the last I'd say

five or six missions at the end of the

game were absolutely amazing they were

fucking great

but everything up to that the nine hours

worth of shitty you know cut the

birthday cake at little Suzy Sweet

sixteen or some shit just dumb fucking

chores if those missions weren't as big

as they were throughout the beginning of

the game this would have been a much

better game it's just you spend so much

time doing so many boring activities

that it takes away from the fun of being

a superhero but then at the end of the

game it really makes up for it and it

gives you a very fun set of missions

that feel amazing to play through with

some great settings some great boss

battles and just a lot of fun to be had

and the combat again is the best part of

this game it never really got old and

was always a joy to be punching teeth in

and fisting assholes of bad guys so yeah

that's it so yeah

Moist Meter | The Nun

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter let's talk about the nun which is

the newest entry into the conjuring

Cinematic Universe spectacle whatever

the fuck bullshitter either trying to

pull they're kind of like Marvel in

theory I like the idea of a horror

franchise all having interconnecting

plots leading to a bigger overall

showdown like the Avengers stuff however

since the conjuring movies aren't that

great it's very underwhelming and be

like as if the emoji movie spawned a

cinematic universe type deal - this is

pretty fucking shitty and the nun is no

exception except the nun is by far the

worst of the entire franchise I mean I

don't even know where to start it seems

like every single horror movie recently

has been filmed by the same guy who just

keeps reusing the same shots and the

same scares the nun uses every generic

spook that you could possibly think of

and nothing new it's like the director

of the nun was just copying the homework

of every other horror movie director

that is also as bad as he is and didn't

change any of the work really he just

put his own spin on it with the bad

things being nuns it's so underwhelming

this is less of a horror movie and more

of like a zombie monster movie it's

really light on anything you can

consider scary and very heavy on here's

some monsters and a really shit plot

there's a scene in here where there's a

guy summoning a demon and it looks

straight out of a videogame and the plot

is he was summoning something evil and

then the Knights came in and stopped the

evil summoning using the Holy Hand

Grenade blood of Christ banished him

back to hell

that's an actual plot point in this

movie it's so fucking dumb it's awful

the movies laughable it's not a good

horror movie at all it's not even a good

movie at all

it's as generic as it could possibly be

but not even generic enough where it's

passable

it's just underwhelming it's just not

good if I could give this movie any

compliments it'd be I like the fucking

theme song they give to the bad

Demon's here like a WWE entrance the

demon has his own theme song whenever

he's on screen they play it and it's

really cool I like that but other than

that it's so underwhelming and much like

all horror movies when they actually

have the showdown with the demon it's

stupid it's like they're fighting the

schoolyard bully doesn't know how to

fight or do anything all he can do is

touch their face like aggressively like

grab at their face and their neck go for

like strangling but he's so fucking dumb

so he'll be like strangling them and

then that stop strangling them to like

fiddle his dick or something off to the

side so then they have a chance to do

something also the priest in this movie

who supposed to be like this elite

Vatican operative to banish demons like

a motherfucker like the Jason Bourne of

demon banishing he does nothing he's

just a perpetual damsel in distress who

contributes nothing to the movie it's

just not a good movie there's very few

compliments I could give this movie so

I'm not even gonna bother trying to fish

for those because they're nitpicky

complements like a couple things I liked

in terms of this setting but let's just

go ahead and plug this shit into the

moist meter I'm giving the nun 25% it's

you know it's a shit ass horror movie as

generic as they get I actually thought

some of the other entries into the

conjuring universe weren't that bad

especially the first conjuring I liked

the first conjuring a lot and Annabel

creation I thought was strong too but

overall it's just a really weak

franchise and this is by far the weakest

one they've thrown into the the melting

pot of shitty horror here I said so yeah

Moist Meter | Searching

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're looking at searching I

went into this movie with no

expectations it's not that the trailers

made me think it was gonna be a bad

movie or anything it's just incredibly

generic and Sundance on it which

basically every movie made now has

Sundance on it it doesn't mean anything

it's not like a stamp of quality or

anything every movie and it's

grandmother's tits have Sundance

plastered on its that didn't impress me

or anything and it also used the gimmick

of this is all from the perspective of a

computer and I hate that kind of shit

it's just oh here's a gimmick thing oh

this movies films from the perspective

of a toothbrush that happened to be near

the scene of the whole entire movie I

mean that's cool but that doesn't really

add much and also this movie is in a

very overdone genre with a very overdone

concept missing teenager all this being

said I didn't have a lot of expectations

and this movie fucking blew me away I

think this is the best the thriller

mystery genre gets this is the smartest

movie I've ever watched it is so well

written and they are able to convey so

much emotion in such a powerful story

through just using words on the computer

screen and searches on the computer

screen scrolling through photos and

occasional facetimes jackson i forgot to

mention this but this is probably an

important point this put somewhere in

the beginning in the beginning the

gimmick of the computer seems pretty

cringy and it seems like the directors

out of touch with how internet culture

works and how it all kind of functions

but as the movie progresses they're

really able to capture exactly how 2018

internet would react to a story like the

one in this movie if if what happened in

this movie happened in the real world

the reaction would be very similar to

the reaction you're gonna see in this

movie it's incredible how realistic he

was able to make this the director did a

fucking great job of actually making it

a believable reaction to the story

especially in a world where people don't

understand the internet in Hollywood so

I'm surprised they didn't just have like

dabbing memes or something just spread

all over Instagram they actually had

exactly what you would expect to see

which is very surprising

every part of this movie it makes it

feel like a real story that we're

watching unfold the the gimmick of it

all being from the computer was honestly

one of the strongest parts of this movie

it was just so fucking incredible to

learn along with the main character

what's going on and all the twists and

turns and piecing it all together and it

is just so fucking good and you'll you

never can guess where it's going next

and the resolution because they

constantly throw more and more things at

you that complicate it and take it in

new directions which is super refreshing

in this genre because most of the new

movies that come out that fall into this

category of film are just so by the

books and obvious you can always pretty

much guess where the plots going and who

the bad guy is it was the creepy

librarian missing her two front teeth

and she did it in the IKEA using the

flashlight as a weapon but wait a minute

that's what you thought it was actually

the really good-looking guy who was also

kind of creepy and he pretty much told

you that he did it right from the get-go

who woulda guessed but here nothing is

obvious you're gonna come up with a

whole bunch bunch of different fuckin

tinfoil hat conspiracy theories I was a

reptilian she got abducted by aliens etc

and then you're gonna be proven wrong

most likely and that's great in a genre

where you can almost always guess how

it's gonna unfold getting surprised with

really well-written twists is so

refreshing and let me say again this

movie is very very well written in a lot

of movies the characters are so fucking

dumb it makes you want to puke

especially like the alien movies where

when the scientists go to a foreign

planet they're in their spring break

gear it's fucking stupid or in the last

Jedi where the commander for some reason

just doesn't tell anyone her plan even

though that would have saved a lot of

trouble and half the movie wouldn't have

even happened this movie has characters

that are really smart and you know if

they ask the questions that you would

expect a real person to ask a smart

person to ask

you know like is he gonna make sure to

mention this small detail because it

might come into play he mentions that

small detail and that small detail comes

into play

everything gets it has a part to play

every detail that you think might be

small comes back and it's probably big

and it's really fucking good everything

just comes together so nicely into this

plot with a really great conclusion

so many twists and turns along the way I

loved it I absolutely loved everything

about this movie if I had to give a one

complaint it would be that it really

does feel too realistic we're like an

old father like an old ass geriatric

patient is using the computer sometimes

with the way the way he moves the mouse

it's so slow it's so goddamn slow

especially when you're an elite

fortnight gaminggod specimen like I am

who's used to flick wristing shit

seeing a man very slowly move his mouse

to the click search button it's painful

that is the only complaint I can even

think of and that's just the biggest

nitpick possible this movie is the best

the thriller genre can get in my opinion

and the acting is superb

all the characters put on a really an

impressive performance I fucking loved

it

now all this having been said and me

completely believing that this is the

best thriller / mystery movie I've ever

seen it's still not a must-see go out of

your way to go watch movie because I

don't think everyone is going to enjoy

it let's plug this shit into the moist

meter I'm giving searching a 90% it is a

fucking amazing movie though I can't

stress that enough and I really do think

it is the best mystery thriller movie

I've ever seen and probably the best

mystery thriller movie that has hit

theaters in a long time because I've

been I've basically been seeing every

fucking new movie that's come out for

like the last two years now so I've seen

a lot of this shit and this is a lot

better than all of that shit in that

category so that's I have nothing but

positive things to say about this movie

that's it so yeah

Moist Meter | A-X-L

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter let's figure out how wet the new

movie Axl is Axl I went in this movie

with very low expectations I expected it

to be extremely shitty and I walked away

pleasantly surprised it's really not

that bad I wouldn't say it's a good

movie but there's a certain charm to it

and I did enjoy my time with the movie

story's simple military was making robot

dogs to annihilate the opponent just

fucking brutalize him one robot dog

breaks out finds a kid kid fixes the

robot dog they form a bond but the

military wants it back it's not a very

creative story it's not gonna have JK

Rowling sweating in her sleep or having

wet dreams about what could have been if

only Harry Potter had robot dogs in it

but the story is serviceable it's simple

which is great for this movie because

this whole movie is just a giant cheese

fest it reminds me of every cheesy

family movie from the 90s not only

reminds me of it this movie actually

looks like one this movie honestly could

have been something I had on VHS as a

kid and they just released it in the

theaters today it it looks straight out

of that era and that's why I say there's

a certain charm to it cuz that it has

every element that every 90s kids movie

with like a wacky premise had like

slappy and the stinkers only 90s kids

remember does anyone else have 90s kid

hard boners right now cuz I mentioned

slappy and the stinkers this movie has

nothing in common with slapping this

thing or slapping the stinkers was about

a seal so this is about a dog two very

different animals one would argue and

not just any dog it's a robot dog like

Jimmy neutrons Goddard whereas slapping

the stinkers slappy was a fucking

real-life seal blood pumping through his

veins not oil not diesel there's nothing

in common between slappy and the robot

dog in this movie Axl there's nothing in

common between them but they still it's

this movie still reminds me of that just

because it has that same type of feel

the same type of structure the same type

of jokes delivery story all of it just

feels right out of the 90s which is nice

it doesn't have a real agenda to push or

anything it doesn't have any bigger

overall message it's just you know

here's a kid

it's struggling with some shitty does

dirtbiking so even more 90s nostalgia

shit right there where dirtbiking used

to be cool and then he finds this dog

and they form a bond

you gotta evade the military and you

gotta get the great-looking girl you got

to slay that pussy too while keeping

your dog safe it's it's fun it's it's an

enjoyable family movie I could totally

see myself as a kid wanting to buy this

movie on VHS and watch the fuck out of

it like it was slapping the stinkers man

I cannot stop mentioning that movie if

you haven't seen slapping the stinkers

wouldn't recommend it it probably hasn't

aged well haven't seen it since I was a

kid but damn it that movies really on my

mind after watching this but yeah I mean

anyway there's really nothing wrong with

the movie but there's nothing good about

it either dialogues super not great a

lot of the acting is also ridiculously

not great across the board say for a

couple characters like Becky G does a

great job I think but really it's not

very good in any aspects at all it just

has that 90s flavor to it where it's

like you know what we know we're not

good let's revel in it and you're still

gonna enjoy it even though you know it's

not good and I can't really put that

into words but I can quantify it in a

moist meter

I'm giving Axl a 30% it's it that's a

very low score because it's objectively

not a good movie no matter how you

measure it it just it isn't very good

but there's just so much to like about

this movie when you go in there and

watch it it's just like fuck this is

some 90s shit like damn this is some

real 90 Jesus he's fucking dirtbiking

and that's a robot dog with jet boosters

in his asshole is this some 90s fucking

shit and it's fun it's a fun movie that

I think most families would probably

enjoy but it's really not a good movie

so I can't give it a higher score

because I'm trying to grade it as like

an actual objective piece here and it's

about a 30% on that report card that's

it so yeah

Moist Meter | Happytime Murders

this episode of moist meter was brought

to you by Nord VPN welcome to the moist

meter I ate a real hot pepper a second

ago cuz I'm trying to get my tolerance

up a lot and Jesus my mouth feels like

the business end of a cow's asshole and

I thought I've ever rimjob the cow or

anything I'm just trying to express it

doesn't feel good today on the moist

meter is a happy time murder I just saw

it just go ahead and talk about it the

rioting fucking sucked but I absolutely

loved the universe they built I thought

it was really a nice creative universe

there's a lot of talent in this movie

the pub the puppeting was fucking

amazing and I really liked the behind

the scenes they did at the end Jesus I

really like the behind the scenes they

did at the end that was a lot of fun to

see how it all kind of came together and

the the ascetic of the whole movie with

the puppets and humans and shit

coexisting but in kind of like a racist

society where the humans hate puppets it

was an interesting dynamic and it led to

some some fun stuff in the movie a

little bit but the writing constantly

has held this bitch back it was mainly

as if like an edgy fourteen-year-old

wrote it like 'hey let's make a puppet

come a lot like a lot of cum like when

you think he's gotta come he comes more

like that's a whole scene in the movie

this story focuses around murders of the

happy happy time gang the happy time

gang was a fictional TV show in their

universe and someone's out murdering all

of them for some reason it's up to two

detectives a puppet and a human to solve

the mystery and then spoiler alert they

do and it's it's satisfying it's fun but

the writing fucking sucks the comedy was

not very good there's a couple zingers

in there that kind of and I made me

smile a little bit for the most part all

the humor fell flat the jokes were

basically just fuck fuck was the

punchline to the majority of the jokes

fuck you no fuck you no fuck you no fuck

fuck you fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck you

and that was the joke rarely will fuck

ever be a punchline to a solid joke it

can help with the build up it can help

with

the delivery and you know the execution

of a joke but never should it be its own

punchline as a joke it doesn't typically

go over very well and it didn't in this

movie it's a shame because this movie I

feel did have a lot of potential with

such a very well executed puppet

performance and a fun story in universe

it's just a shame that as a comedy movie

it was really not good as a comedy at

all it just tried too hard for just the

general Shaak all these are puppets

doing things puppets shouldn't be doing

puppets they're supposed to be for kids

but these puppets are at a strip club in

a porn shop what the fuck yikes and

don't tell your mom about these puppets

on this movie

it's a shame so let's go ahead and plug

this shit into the moist meter I'm

giving a happy time murders at 35%

because like I said love the universe

and there are a couple of zingers in

here a little bit but it is just not a

very good movie overall very weak

it seems very lazy in terms of its

writing and it's all the characters are

fine just the dialogue didn't help the

characters at all so it's just fucking

bad comedy but an interesting movie with

a fun little universe that they put

together and men do I have a lot of

respect for how this movie was made

after seeing behind the scenes it looks

like such a tedious task and it's clear

a lot of passion went into the actual

art of puppeting puppeteering whatever I

don't know what the verb is or the sport

or whatever but it shouldn't touch my

but it was impressive that's it see ya

howdy folks

Moist Meter | Mission Impossible: Fallout

initiating moisture I know in the last

moist meter I said that Jackson was on

an extended vacation so the moist meter

quality would go to shit during this

time cuz I can't do the same type of

editing he does with the production and

the effects and shit however I'm happy

to report that a mystical magical wood

elf fairy godmother named Jay Mac has

stepped up to the plate and offered to

deliver high quality moist meter editing

so thank you Jay Mac let's go ahead and

get right into this shit now

mission impossible fallout I'm a huge

fan of the mission and mission

impossible franchise and I really hope

one day we'll see an Ethan Hunt versus

James Bond crossover kind of like Freddy

vs. Jason

Ethan Hunt first James Bond James Bond

to win and fucking girls department but

I think Ethan Hunt would have the edge

in like pure high-octane diesel pumping

testosterone cum inducing action now

onto this movie instead of focusing on

my fan fiction pipe dreams cinematic

experience crossover events which I do

believe should absolutely happen this

movie's exceptional the action is

spectacular but there's a lot of things

that I think absolutely fell short the

biggest being the plot the plot is the

exact same plot that we've seen in

Mission Impossible movies before and I

mean the exact same I don't want to give

anything away but it is a one-to-one

copy of previous Mission Impossible

plots I don't know how many fucking

times they can you know assume Ethan's

the bad guy

like in rogue nation Oh Ethan was in

Austria when the Prime Minister was

assassinated even assassinated the

Austrian Prime Minister what the fuck it

was definitely Ethan let's hunt him down

I don't know how many times they can do

that and they've done that so many

fucking times and they keep doing it for

some reason it's just like in 24 you

know how in 24 when Jack Bauer every

single season was being hunted by his

own government that's IMF that's the

Mission Impossible movies that's always

the plot it's you know it's like when

they say don't copy my homework exactly

and then you just change your name on it

or change one word in it that's what

Mission Impossible does with its

previous plots and it works because what

these plots allow them to do is deliver

some very high stakes action sequences

and a lot of crazy shit so I don't mind

it that much but it's very lazy it's

just really

fucking lazy Oh what plot should we do

guys what did we do three movies ago

dude do people still remember that one

let's just do that again

fuck it I don't think they'll remember

but I remember I've seen them all I like

them all

of course I remember why would you

insult me like that by reusing the same

plot regardless though plots lazy but it

doesn't take too much away from the

movie because the plot still enables it

to have these crazy scenes and there's a

lot of really fucking amazing scenes in

this movie with just really jaw-dropping

and unique action that's filmed so well

that I can't help but mention how

incredible the cinematography is here

and how well everything is shot so the

action all flows together beautifully

and creates a really memorable action

movie the Tom Cruise kills it per usual

I love that he does all his own stunts

and I think that really adds an extra

flavor to all the Mission Impossible

movies dude fucking broke his ankle

during one of the scenes and then kept

limping off and they use that take in

the movie and you can see he's like

fucking wincing in pain like ouch that's

a broken ass ankle I got a boo-boo down

there and he still plays it off because

he's a goddamn professional damn

Scientology must give you super powers

or something because Tom Cruise fucking

kills it in these roles besides just the

amazing action now there's not really

too much else I really need to talk

about performances are solid across the

board except for maybe Luther in some

parts because he had to deliver like an

emotional speech about Ethan's wife and

it was just kind of uncomfortable to

listen to because it just felt so forced

and unnecessary kind of like someone

walked into the writing room and said

well let's shoehorn some emotion in this

bitch where's where's the emotion at

okay let me write something real quick

I'll scribble something down that made

it in there that was kind of goofy but

other than that solid performances it

knows what it needs to focus on it has a

very clear goal it just wants to deliver

some cool shit to you and it succeeds

although I do need to mention I think it

goes a bit overboard on like the classic

Mission Impossible formula with the

masks and shit there's an over-reliance

on double cross super cross I had you

before you had me because I knew what

your move is gonna be also I hope you're

used to hearing the phrase that's what

he wants us to do because they say that

exact phrase verbatim at least 50

fucking times in this movie almost as

many times as they did in rogue nation

not quite as many there but almost as

much here so I hope you're excited to

hear that phrase

a million times but it's still a very

good movie let's go ahead and plug this

shit into the moist me and I'm giving

Mission Impossible Fallout and 80% it

excels where it needs to it

wants to be a very good action movie and

it's an excellent action movie I think

it's the best in the Mission Impossible

series and a very very good action movie

overall they've clearly mastered the

formula they they want to make a very

fun shove popcorn in your face and just

be entertained action movie and they

succeeded it's a great fucking action

movie so yeah

Moist Meter | Teen Titans GO To the Movies

welcome to a low-budget edition of the

moist meter Jackson's on an extended

vacation so the next five or six moist

meters will be low quality like this

because I can't edit like Jackson does

so it's gonna be shot like a fucking

home movie I'm sorry about that but

let's get right into it Teen Titans go

to the movies Teen Titans is a cartoon

series I grew up on I loved it I've seen

every episode in multiple times and as a

kid it awakened something in me sexually

because I was attracted to a couple of

the female characters in the show I'm

not a fan of hint I these days but maybe

just because I didn't really follow

through with that passion that I had as

a kid too cartoon characters really

there's no telling and I really wouldn't

like to know because if I did like hint

I'd feel like such a fucking degenerate

not insulting any of you out there you

hentai enthusiasts just saying I

personally would feel dirty if I liked

the cartoon character sex moving on from

that when Teen Titans go first started

airing on Cartoon Network I gave it a

very fair shake of the sauce bottle I

watched a lot of episodes and I gave it

like maybe two seasons and I'd seen a

lot of it and I can say with certainty I

think it sucks shitty stinky stuff

because it's a shitty stinky show I

don't like it

I really don't like Teen Titans go

nowadays it's not even cartoon network

that airs Teen Titans go it's just the

Teen Titans go network that whole

fucking channel is just Teen Titans go

now I urge you look at a cartoon network

programming schedule for a day and you

will see almost nothing but Teen Titans

go I don't like it now that being said I

like this movie I think this is a very

good movie I was hoping it'd be like

Lego Batman because that movie just

caught me by surprise at how great it

was I've never seen the lego movie but I

went into Lego Batman and I loved it and

I was hoping this could capture that

same magic and it doesn't but it kind of

comes close it's a mix of Lego Batman

and shitty Teen Titans go it's very much

more of a kids movie though as opposed

to Lego Batman which was great for

anyone of all ages this is more geared

towards kids both in its plot and its

jokes and that's not necessarily a bad

thing there's still a lot to like here

even as an adult it's a fine movie it's

clever sometimes the plot simple Robin

wants a Teen Titans movie because all

the other superheroes have superhero

movies so the whole plot is basically

trying to get them a movie and all the

jokes are centered around very

metis shit like making fun of DC making

fun of superhero movies in general and

that's fun that works that's always fun

I guess that's DC's newest thing where

they just make fun of all their shit and

then keep producing shit like they can

clearly recognize they produce shitty

shit and yet they don't feel the need to

improve I think this is a conspiracy

theorist coming out in me but I think DC

continues to pump out shit just so they

can make fun of it in later productions

that's my theory at least but anyway

let's talk the positives here there's

some fucking zingers in here there's

some clever jokes good writing the

animation is fucking beautiful

I don't really like the character design

but everything aside from the characters

is breathtaking the colors gorgeous the

animation flawless fucking top-notch

I love 2d animation I will always

support anything that's 2d animated I

don't hate 3-d or computer-generated but

nothing can get your penis harder than

some good old-fashioned solid 2d

animation and this fucking nails it and

although the story super cliche as is

the message it's super heartwarming I

mean this it's you know it's just an

uplifting type of movie with a positive

message about you know friendship and

being yourself and shit and that's you

know that's always fine that's always a

nice thing let's talk about the

negatives though cuz there's there is a

lot to dislike about this movie I can't

fucking stand how much they overuse star

fire and Beast Boy stalking quips the

whole beast boy who is we that was the

the was is Bros abuzz bridge bro bro bro

bro bro bro

and then Starfire Robin the friend the

friend Robin different the friend the

friend that was that is the was the the

fucking dialogue between those two like

that's mostly their lines it was awful

I would have rather listen to someone

grading their nails on a chalkboard

while also farting in my face it was

painful to keep hearing that I hated

that I mean a wonderful couple times

throughout the movie that'd be fine but

it's almost every time they opened their

mouth they're doing that same goddamned

thing and I understand it's part of

their characters but it's not like in

the show that's the only way they talk

they know how to talk normal I also

really didn't like how many musical

numbers there were in this movie there

was like at least eight full-blown

musicals in here

it's not like the music itself was bad

but just so much of it it felt like they

had like 10 different Studios that they

had already hired to work on this movie

and they just didn't really know what to

do with them so they just said you know

what can you just do a cool fucking

music video that will shoehorn into the

plot somewhere aren't great then they

put it all in the movie at the very end

just so much musical numbers out of

nowhere none of them like actually bad

on their own but when they're all

together crammed like three within the

span of 15 minutes it's tiresome to keep

hearing it so that was a big negative

for me if they only had a couple it

would have been great because they like

I said they're not bad like they're not

bad on their own but it's just when

they're in this combination of like a

jab jab haymaker of musicals left and

right you get tired of it you absolutely

do let's just plug this shit into the

moist meter I'm giving Teen Titans go to

the movies another negative I don't like

the title I'm giving it a 70% on the

moist meter it's a good movie

it really is it's not - Lego Batman it's

it's a kids movie it's more so a kids

movie than something like Lego Batman

where it's kids and adults this is more

geared towards kids but it's really not

bad it's good it's enjoyable it's a good

use of your time if you want something

to do or you don't have anything else to

see and I also really really really

fucking love what they what they

revealed or hinted at at the

post-credits scene or one of the

post-credits scenes rather that is

exciting shit very exciting shit and

that alone may have been worth watching

the movie even if even if I hated it

that would have been worth it to get

that payoff but I didn't hate it it's a

good movie so yeah

Moist Meter | Gene Rain

initiating moisture gene rain is without

a doubt the most mind-numbing ly awful

gaming experience of experienced in 2018

every adjective that you could possibly

ever use to describe a road-killed

animal that had shit itself right before

becoming roadkill and then it just got

killed and smooshed into the shit became

this disgusting abomination of roadkill

and feces every adjective you could ever

use to describe that scene is applicable

to gene rain every one of those

adjectives fits perfectly at home when

describing gene rain every emotion that

you would experience when looking at a

pile of dog vomit is an emotion you will

feel when playing gene rain everything

you've come to expect from video games

has been thrown out the fucking window

for gene rain this game tries to

reinvent what we've come to understand

as existence

I suppose this game challenges your very

ideas of what it means to exist in a

corporeal dimension this game I can't

even put into words how brutal it is to

play the best compliment I can give gene

rain objectively speaking is that at

least it's only a three hour game that's

the best thing it has going for it now

the game is incredibly bad I think I've

made that abundantly clear every

possible category for gaming that you

you could ever grade a game based on

this has a zero a hard fucking zero but

what this game does have is charm the

dialogue is so poorly written the script

is as if someone was using Google

Translate for the first time and decided

to try to Google Translate a

Shakespearean play and then put it into

the game and it's so beautifully

delivered by the voice actors that are

clearly not native English speakers and

have never even heard the words they're

pronouncing it is so beautiful it's a

beautiful catastrophe when it comes to

storytelling and dialogue and it is so

fucking fun the story is

incomprehensible and all over the place

it's diving into the mind of a lunatic

it is so

fucking crazy and it's it's amazing it's

such a wild ride that no one out there

at all will ever be able to fully

understand at all and even the slightest

and the best part

they're planning a sequel they're

planning a fucking sequel and I'm

excited I like bad games and this is

probably one of the worst I've ever

played half the time your bullets don't

even work you might as well be shooting

confetti at them or just kind of blowing

really hard in their direction the

fucking loading times are excruciatingly

long the checkpoints are unforgiving

you'll be sent back to the fucking

beginning of the level if you slip up at

the very end the the invisible walls are

abundant so sometimes you'll just be

walking around in this you can't go that

way even though it looks like an go that

way because there's an invisible wall

there there's so much wrong with the

game the enemies of the most uninspired

asset flips I've ever seen they all have

the most generic names in the world like

one of them is called ninja and the

other ones are just black mechanical guy

silver mechanical guy mechanical guy who

guards things those are real titles for

real enemies in the game and shooting

them is the worst experience ever taking

cover hardly ever works the melee is

broken you may as well have just never

even bothered having that button on your

controller there's so much wrong with

the game it's such a fucking bad game i

streamed the whole thing start to finish

and it was an hour there excuse me was

three hours and four minutes to beat

start to finish on the stream and I look

at it as a positive experience the game

was so bad it revolutionized what I

perceive as bad games

it was fucking legendarily bad it's

fucking crazy it's such a wild ride but

I would never recommend it to anyone

because it's $25 for this three-hour

lack of thrill adventure but goddamn

this is such a unique awful title this

is like a Neal Breen videogame it's

fucking great but not it's not good it's

not great it's not good it's there's

nothing great about it please let me

make that clear if that's not clear

enough let me plug this shit into the

moist meter

I'm giving Jean Rayne a 2% on the moist

meter that's the lowest score I've ever

given the only reason it's a 2% is

because there is fun to be had because

of how objectively bad the game is but

everything in this game is basically a

zero percent it's hardly even functional

it didn't crash but it did drop a lot of

frames the game barely works you'll be

fucked by things that you had no chance

of fighting back with bullets going

through the wall coming through the

ground God Himself smiting you whole

bunch of things wrong with the game

everything wrong with the game but it is

still so bad that it can be fun 2% on

the moist meter baby that's a new

milestone great fucking work gene rain

I'm excited for the sequel see ya

Moist Meter: Ant-Man and the Wasp

this episode of moist meadow was brought

to you by Nord VPN more on that at the

end welcome to the quantum moist meter

today we're going to quantumly analyze

the quantum moisture found within the

new ant-man movie what am I saying

quantum so much well it's because this

movie says the word quantum so many

fucking times it reminds me that episode

of Spongebob and rock bottom where it's

can't understand your accent you know

but in this movie instead of doing them

it says the word quantum it is

everywhere in this movie and it will

make you forget that quantum is a

real-world real real word by the end of

it this is absolutely the weakest MCU

movie in my opinion but that being said

it's not a bad movie there's a lot about

this movie that's just very stinky but

overall it's an alright movie so let's

just go ahead and start with a story cuz

that's the worst part the stories are so

fucking lazy and haphazardly tossed

together it's almost insulting in its

blatant laziness that's almost like

they're spitting on your intelligence

I'm not gonna try and spoil anything to

major if I do spoil something it's gonna

be very minor so don't jerk yourself off

too feverishly in the comments about how

I spoiled that Scott Lang's hair is a

little longer in this movie than in the

last one

the story of Scott Lang's under house

arrest for events of previous movies but

he needs to hop back in the saddle

because Hank and hope need him so he's

got a rock and roll go big go small

blast balls because he's got another

huge mission and that mission is they're

going to get the mom back that's I hope

that's not a spoiler because that's

revealed within the first couple of

minutes of the movie that's the whole

purpose so they want to get her out of

the quantum realm how do they explain

how she survived 30 years in the quantum

realm with no food and no water and

really no way of being able to survive

well their explanation was very

thought-provoking scientific and

thorough the explanation was well things

move differently down there thank you

now it all makes sense that about covers

it and that's pretty much the whole tone

of the rest of the movies story they

just throw this

should at you and expect you to just

take it at face value not think much on

it and I guess that's not such a bad

thing it's a superhero movie but this

one is so much worse in terms of its

story because this whole movie's plot

could have been avoided within the first

30 minutes of the movie in 30 minutes

the movie could have been done kaput

everyone happy the main villain of this

movie is a character named ghost she can

face through shit and she wants the

technology that Hank and hope are using

to get their mom back because she needs

it and had Hank Hope and Scott

communicated with ghosts what they

wanted to do how they were gonna do it

ghost would have been on their side and

they could have all worked together and

been this super team and got everything

salt and everyone would have been fine

all parties happy there was no reason

that ghosts should have even been a

villain had they just talked to her or

had she talked to them and communicated

the hero's goals and the villains goals

were exactly the fucking same except for

one small detail in the villains goals

that really you could have talked her

out of or convinced her to just hold off

on a little bit it'd be as if you were

working on a take home quiz in school

with your friend and you both got the

same answer but your friend didn't show

all the work you showed it'd be like you

then going out of your way to slap your

friend and never talk to them again

because of that and you just mortal

enemies it's so fucking dumb it could

have been avoided it should have it's

just such a shit plot and aside from

that there's so many other polls on this

plot it's embarrassing it really is but

you would think with them not putting

too much of a focus on the plot they

make up for it with cool scenes and

action and a lot of cool shit happening

on-screen but they don't there's almost

no action in this movie until the very

end and even that's pretty underwhelming

you get a couple scenes of action

sprinkled here and there a little

tinkles of ass bits of action here but

the action you do get here isn't very

interesting every fight just kind of

boils down the punch shrink kick shrink

punch punch ouch

I'm hurt that's the end of the fight

it's very not impressive it's it's like

a fucking n64 game with limited

animation so they did the best

they could with what they had it's

basically fucking Rock'em Sock'em robots

with the occasional shrinking they just

never really used this shit that makes

them superheroes in the first place they

use it occasionally but not very much

and not in interesting ways at all this

movie is carried heavily by great comedy

writing and great character dialogue and

that's good that it's so good in that

department because that's the majority

of this movie this movie is mainly just

characters tossing pseudoscience he

terms at one another as if every

character is just reading some type of

sci-fi tumblr blog post with science

terms to sound smart at a bar to impress

women tip your fedora at the end sirs

for Milady's but when it's not

desperately trying to make sense of a

plot and it's just tossing good jokes at

you and good character dialogue it's

it's an alright movie it's fine but it's

just not a good superhero movie because

it doesn't have anything that makes it a

superhero movie

it has OK visuals when they go to the

quantum realm that's kind of cool but

that lasts all of 5 minutes and that's

it's it it's it's just not a good MCU

movie it's an alright movie because it's

carried so heavily by good comedy

writing but past that there's just

nothing of value here except good acting

but it's a Marvel movie you're going to

get good acting let's go ahead and plug

this shit into the moist meter

I'm giving ant-man in the wasp but 55%

it's an average movie it's ok there are

some jokes that I had a little giggle at

and smile that then there was times when

I was sinking to my seat because when I

was looking at was just embarrassing or

what I was hearing was just

nonsensically embarrassing to listen to

it's just it seems like this movie was

such an afterthought in the MCU like

they'd already written all the movies

and they'd already written infinity war

but then one in turn one brave intern

accidentally spoke a little too loudly

in a hushed whisper and everyone threw

their hands up in the air fuck we have

Ant Man don't we wanna do something with

him alright let's just go ahead and

fucking ham-fisted into the infinity war

plot so we kind of explain that and

we'll just dedicate a movie to them with

like a fifty dollar budget I guess you

get complete of good riders here right

let's write some good shit and then you

can we'll give you a little bit for

action but let's not use too much of

that let's pull a plot out of our ass

let's do it boys we got

gonna happen quick this seems like this

movie had no real purpose to exist this

movie seems very trivial there's almost

nothing that happens in this movie that

feels like it has any impact on the MCU

except for the post credit scene the

post credit scene was very well done and

I really liked the post credits scene

but overall this movie just seems

pointless and useless trivial it seems

like just it's so unrelated to

everything and just not anything

important and it really feels like no

one really cared about it it's a shame

because the first ant-man was really

good and this one's it's pretty it's

pretty stinky in a lot of ways but like

I said it's okay it's alright hey folks

Moist Meter: The First Purge

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter let's analyze the wetness found

within the new purge movie so the purge

franchise is a series I find very

interesting on a conceptual level and I

think at times they have a very

interesting and cool story to tell but

the movies are stinky ass bombs I don't

think they're very good and I don't even

know what they're trying to be I don't

know if they're trying to be horror

movies or scary because they don't even

come close to succeeding and being a

competent scary horror movie it's about

as scary as going on the Fortnight

forums on Epic Games calm or reading the

are creepy subreddit there's just

nothing frightening about these movies

they don't really succeed in being

action movies either which it seems like

they're more geared towards what they're

going for is a more action-oriented

movie series but they don't do that very

well either because they just use

shaky-cam 100% of the time but anyway

the first purge is the new one it's

about the first purge it as an

experiment on Staten Island where the

new founding fathers put it into action

to see how it go over and the story just

follows characters trying to survive it

and also piecing together what exactly

is going on and and really just trying

to figure out what the true purpose of

the purge is now I want to talk about

the overarching story because I like it

quite a bit but I can't even talk about

this movie at all without mentioning

that it is just filled to the anus

with political commentary and I'm not

exaggerating when I say it will fist

your dick hole with social and political

commentary and stances for a lot of

people that's going to be a turn-off for

me personally I didn't really care much

because it makes sense in this movies

universe but they really went so far

into making these stances and statements

that it really does detract from the

movie as a whole not even that the movie

was even that great to begin with it's a

mediocre movie at best but anyway let's

just talk about the fucking story

because I do like that America is

getting fucked belly-up and the new

founding fathers solution is legalizing

all crime but what they really want is

murder they want a lot of dead people

during the 12-hour purge and I think

that's cool this movie has some good

characters and by some good characters I

mean one good

the main character Dimitri I think he's

a badass everyone every other character

in this movie was 2-dimensional and

uninteresting they didn't do any cool

shit to me treated all the cool shit he

did all the cool shit got every cool

shit trophy award for this movie he was

fun to watch on the screen everyone else

was not and I really hate and this isn't

all the purge movies that they have like

this perception of crazy people as if

they asked a fourth-grader what they

think a crazy person is Oh crazy person

is someone who doesn't like Doritos or

somebody that will step on a bag of

gummy worms and not even cry about it so

then they take that and they put that

idea of a crazy person in the movie as a

perjure what I mean by this is it's

pathetic watching them make crazy

perjures in this movie they have this

over reliance on dolls and babies and

baby dolls that's apparently the

scariest shit in the world because every

purger has some variation of that as

their stick as their wow this person's

fucking insane get this man to Arkham

Asylum he's carrying around a fucking

doll there's these two old women pushing

shopping carts full of stuffed animals

and dolls and then they set them on the

pavement rigged with firecrackers and

they laugh as they blow them up yikes

terrifying I'm gonna be up all night

there's a man who hides in the sewer

who's wearing a baby doll mask making

baby noises as he's grabbing some

woman's leg dragged near it in the sewer

and grabbing her pussy and she says

pussy grabbed her wow what a subtle

donald trump reference and damn that

baby mask and baby noise shit was scary

it's just fucking ridiculous and it

sympathetic and embarrassing

one of the main insane OHS here was a

man called Skeletor Skeletor and his

craziness was I'm crazy I'm gonna kill

people because I'm crazy I don't like

people I'm crazy skeletor's character in

a nutshell and he kills people that's it

it's fucking dumb I guess that's their

attempt at horror but I really don't

know because it's not scary and they

don't even try to make it scary they do

like a couple jump scares I think they

tried I don't I don't really know

because they didn't work it's just

pathetic their attempt to crazy perjures

it's embarrassing to watch when they're

not throwing those embarrassing

caricatures of crazy people and they

have like actual you know people that

are shooting guns and shit and you know

doing some crazy shit that's alright and

then they have let Lee it's the

action scenes with a mediocre shaky-cam

but they have some okay shots that are

fun to watch and they have some blood

spilling so it at least isn't super

boring to watch which I guess is a

compliment but overall it's just it

doesn't succeed in any area it goes for

it has an overarching story that I think

is very strong but they just don't know

how they want to use it at times they're

going for that cheap scare or some type

of horror suspense thriller type deal

that never works and other times they're

just going for in-your-face action which

also doesn't work that well because they

don't film it well

Dmitry's action scenes are pretty strong

like when he's fighting in the stairwell

it's alright but the shakey cam makes it

unwatchable so they I just don't know

what area they they wanted to focus on

because they didn't succeed in any in my

opinion except for the soundtrack if

this movie was just one big music video

for a bunch of different songs that they

played throughout here this would be the

shit if that's what they were going for

they succeeded because the music in this

movie is a fucking banger that music is

great whoever did the soundtrack good

shit really enjoyed the music in this

one that's not something I ever really

pay too much attention to but damn they

really killed it with the soundtrack

here I really enjoyed it a lot but past

that everything else was just anywhere

from mediocre to just embarrassing in my

opinion it's just you know you can do so

much more with the concept instead of

struggle to find your identity in it but

let's go ahead and plug this shit into

the moist meter I'm giving the first

purge a 30% great concept some decent

action scenes Demetri is a badass

fucking banging soundtrack but man it's

a stink-ass movie in my opinion that's

not great don't see it as a horror movie

see it as something that you just you

have nothing else to do and you want to

waste an hour in 30 minutes or something

it's not a boring movie by any means but

you're not gonna walk out of there super

pleased with how you spent your time

that's it so yeah

Moist Meter | Hereditary

this episode is brought to you by the

fine folks of Dollar Shave Club modern

horror movies are akin to a pile of dog

shit in my opinion that the most lazy

formulaic and boring movies that get

made and they're only made as cash grabs

so high schoolers can bring their

girlfriend there and they can both go ah

at the jump scare fest that's not to say

there haven't been great horror movies

made though in the last couple of years

however hereditary is the best one by

far if horror movies were dick-measuring

contest than hereditary has the penis

size of three semi trucks lined up in to

end this movie is so far above any other

horror movie I've seen in at least the

last decade it's unreal I don't even

want to touch on the story of this movie

because I feel like even talking about

what it's about will spoil some of the

actual content of the movie but I'm

going to say this movie has the most

amazing story I've ever seen a horror

movie right up until the last 10 minutes

of the movie the last 10 minutes of the

movie really just dropped trouser and

take a hard shit on everything that was

built up to that point

I really was upset with how they

finished off the movie but everything up

to it was nothing should I have a horror

masterpiece the story is a very

unnerving one and it's gonna show you a

lot of things that are uncomfortable to

look at which get taken to the next

level by the performances of the actors

here absolutely amazing acting in this

movie and that's not something I

particularly care about I don't really

pay a lot of attention to it I'm not

grading by oh he didn't raise his

eyebrows when he was supposed to be

super surprised this is horrible acting

10 points off and I'm never seeing this

movie again boycott this movie because I

didn't like his micro facial expressions

that's not something I care about but

when the acting is this good it's

something I think everyone notices

because it really made the characters

alive it made it seem like you were

watching a real family

go insane and have all types of

incredibly disturbing shit happen to

them it was it was jaw-dropping I've

never seen acting like this

in a movie and especially not a fucking

horror movie where everyone's just a

cardboard cutout of the most boring

two-dimensional character imaginable

this was amazing everyone fucking killed

it in their role

in this movie the next part that makes

this movie so great is they don't have

this over reliance on jump scares like

every other mainstream horror movie does

there are a couple of jump scares here

but they're used sparingly and

appropriately and they're not the main

scare the scariest thing about this

movie the scariest things you experience

here is the psychological shit of what

the family's going through and you feel

like they're actually going through it

because of the performances and some of

the shit you see some of the things are

just disgusting to look at at parts and

that's exactly how horror should be it

shouldn't be like did I scare the shit

out of you you know that's not scary

that's okay you made a loud noise

obviously it's gonna startle me a little

bit but at the end of the day it's just

goofy and dumb here it actually uses

real scary shit which I can always

appreciate up until the end like I said

the last 10 minutes take everything it

did right and then just kind of throw it

into a toilet and ejaculate on it but up

until that last 10 minutes everything

here was unique scary

disturbing and just incredibly enjoyable

to watch now I feel like I should

absolutely mention the last ten minutes

and why I take issue with it well up

until the last 10 minutes of this movie

everything has you guessing as to why

things are happening and it also is

using a lot of unique approaches to

startle it will not startle you but to

unnerve you whereas the last 10 minutes

take every generic horror movie scene

and combine them into one montage like a

2008 YouTube era montage of generic

horror movies shit and it didn't land

well at all it was just kind of pathetic

in my opinion and the explanation for

why everything was happening was also

kind of shit they hinted at it building

up to that but I was hoping it wouldn't

be as in-your-face and just downright

silly to listen to when they explain it

nor should do I think they should have

explained it right to your face like

that it took away a lot as well but when

I say it doesn't land well the audience

was laughing at some of the shit because

they've seen it all before

so when you see for example a scary

thing looming in the background and

there's kind of floating away I mean

it's nothing like yikes that's scary

that's new I've never seen that that's

really startling and disturbing it's not

because everyone's used to that that's a

generic horror movie shit that's that

had no place in this movie because

they hadn't done that at all in this

entire movie right up until the end and

it just ruins a lot of it it really does

and it's really sad because this was a

horror masterpiece I think it still is

if you can disregard the last ten

minutes and just just go ahead and put

that as like a spin off like a side

story that got roped in here like you

know how in a Pixar movie they do a

little short at the beginning well

hereditary did that at the end the movie

ended 10 minutes before the short plays

that's how I'm gonna look at it because

it's just got a goddamn shame it really

is and that really honestly is my only

complaint about hereditary everything

else is honestly just amazing the sound

is great everything feels like it's

happening and sounds like it's happening

the movies shot in a really unique way

it has some really cool transitions it

has some really great framing and that's

not something I ever touch on because I

don't think too many people care if the

framing and the shots are shitty you'll

notice and that's a bad thing but if

they're done right you should never even

consider it but it is something I

occasionally pay attention to and in

this movie it's hard not to notice how

well executed it is let's go just go

ahead and plug this shit into the moist

meter I'm giving hereditary an 85 and it

hurts me to give it an 85 because I

think it should be more but like I said

those last 10 or so minutes are just

they're stinky and more likely than not

if you see this in theaters people are

going to laugh during that part I was

too because it is just goofy and I don't

know why they did that

I really don't I'm guessing they were

just running out of time or just didn't

care anymore a fucking fuck if I know

I'm not gonna try and understand what

they decided for the last 10 minutes

maybe they just handed it off to the

directors fourth grader I really have no

other explanation but everything except

for the last ten minutes is a horror

masterpiece that I think anyone who

enjoys a horror movie will fucking love

hereditary is absolutely fantastic

almost as fantastic as Dollar Shave Club

a lot of you know Dollar Shave Club

sponsors the official podcast and they

were demanding more they needed more so

Jackson and I said they're welcome to

come on the moist meter for hereditary

so Jackson take the stage take it away

ahead of moisture relations Jackson here

with some exciting news if moist meter

is known for one thing is that we

Moist Meter | Incredibles 2

initiating moisture it's the moist meter

making you what today we're looking at a

movie I've been extremely excited about

Incredibles fuckin - the first

Incredibles is my favorite Pixar movie

it's my favorite animated movie ever

made and I'm not just looking at it

through rose-tinted vaginas

I saw a double feature where they did

Incredibles and then Incredibles two

back-to-back the first one still holds

up super fuckin well it is still an

incredible movie to see so for all five

of you who haven't seen it I would

recommend you check it out

so Incredibles 2 picks up mere seconds

after the last one ends and it's been 14

years between the first one and second

one that's a long time that's enough

time for someone to have been born and

learn about jerking off and put jerking

off into practice during the release

period of these two movies the point I'm

making it's been a long fuckin time and

they haven't missed a beat they still

have all the momentum from all those

years ago the movies fucking great story

is simple they want to make superheroes

legal again they have two very powerful

people to help make them make that a

reality except the new supervillain

comes along the complicated it's a very

simple story that's able to deliver a

very fun ride for the audience it

allowed them to introduce a lot more

supervillains with some really cool

superpowers to lead to a lot more super

fucking fights which is always nice to

see from this there's a really badass

fight scene between Jack Jack and a

raccoon Jack Jack has this myriad of

powers that he unleashes all on this

raccoon who's able to match his every

move and it leads to a really

entertaining fight one that blows

everything the DC Universe has put on

the big screen out of the water all of

that CGI shit show shit blaster awful

bore snoozefest action in DC movies was

destroyed by Incredibles - Jack Jack

versus raccoon fight alone that fight

was able to match a Marvel fight scene

it was really fucking good and all the

fight scenes are for the most part this

is the rare sequel where it met my

expectations for it it was able to meet

14 years worth of hype and expectations

which is a fucking tall order

that's like Jesus being revived for a

third time Jesus Mark 3 comes to earth

and people are satisfied yep that's the

Jesus I wanted to see that's about right

that looks about right met my

expectations and some

amazing it is really fucking incredible

what they were able to do here with this

sequel I was expecting to be

disappointed but I wasn't at all I

walked away extremely satisfied with

what I watched and it's Pixar so you as

you would expect the voice acting is

second to none

all the performance are delivered the

best way they possibly could to bring

the characters to life in this beautiful

world however I have to say this movie

doesn't have the same type of impact the

first one had the first Incredibles was

a fucking game-changer that turned the

world of animation on its asshole this

movie is more of just a play it safe

stay in that same era and just deliver a

kickback fun adventure action movie just

an entertaining ride nothing that's

gonna change the landscape nothing

that's going to have this huge lasting

impact not like the first one so in a

way it feels underwhelming because it

couldn't quite reach that same godhood

status that the first one was able to

reach Incredibles 2 isn't a dam that

just changed everything it's more of a

dam that was a refreshing sequel but dam

is it a real refreshing sequel it kept

the spirit of the first one alive

everything the first one did is emulator

in the second one and it even borrows

some of the same themes and plot points

a little bit but that's not a huge

negative thing you would kind of expect

that says it picks up literally right

where it left off but I'm very very

happy with how the sequel turned out I

really am and I don't think too many

people are gonna be disappointed by

Incredibles 2 so I'm just gonna go ahead

and plug this shit into the moist meter

I'm giving Incredibles 2 a 90% I do

think it's a fantastic fucking movie

that just falls short on living up to

what the Incredibles 1 was able to

achieve it does everything Incredibles 1

did and it keeps it up here it keeps all

that momentum but it really does feel

more just like we've seen this before

we've seen this now from a lot of other

animated movies back when Incredibles

one came along we've never seen anything

like it now it's more this is fun we've

seen it before but I'm still having a

lot of fun seeing it again which isn't a

bad thing and it's still a really really

good movie that is absolutely worth

seeing 100 fuckin % see ya

Moist Meter: Jurassic World Evolution

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter III conference today we're

announcing jurassic world evolution it's

an extremely boring almost Park sim

where dinosaurs of the main characters

but the best part it's out today I bet

you didn't know that so I'm basically

breaking fuckin news on this one if

Jackson wasn't a hardcore dinosaur fan I

would have never known about this game

now I got my two main complaints out of

the way about this right now it's very

boring and it's not a park sim game at

all it's more of a managerial type game

which is fine in and of its own right

but I went into this expecting a park

simulator kind of in the same vein of

like rollercoaster tycoon or Jurassic

Park Genesis which was the previous

attempt at a game like this which I

found was mediocre at best it was fine

and that's kind of how I feel about this

game it's passable it's functional it

does what you would kind of expect it to

do and less so what do I mean when I say

it's not a park sim well the game is

mainly about keeping your dinosaurs

satisfied it's kind of like a fucking

survival game mixed with a children's

toy meant to teach them responsibility

and how to care for something that's

overly needy because these dinosaurs are

constantly needing you to wipe their ass

and fulfill their every fucking desire

it's amazing how difficult and

convoluted that system can be but at the

same time it can also be kind of

rewarding but it is not a park sim game

there is no emphasis on creating a

really cool park with a lot of cool

features because there aren't very many

features to be added to your park the

core gameplay formula is very simple

research some dinosaurs put some

dinosaurs in a cage and then meet their

requirements that's really what the

whole game boils down to and then people

come to see the dinosaurs there's not a

whole lot more thought that goes into it

but that doesn't mean it's an easy game

because sometimes it can be chaotically

difficult to meet those requirements and

still manage the rest of the park which

in my opinion is a good thing but what

isn't a good thing in my opinion or the

opinion of any other sane person on the

planet is the incredible lack of depth

of the dinosaurs they look beautiful the

dinosaur design is great in the whole

game looks absolutely beautiful visually

and you can make some absolutely

stunning parks for sure

but there is no animations on anything

in this game an incredible lack of

animation and the dinosaur fights if you

can even fucking call them that it's

like smashing two action figures

together it is pathetic it's its mobile

game level of action so if you fight two

dinosaurs together you might as well get

a blanket and pillow out because it's

gonna put your ass to sleep it's so

boring so underwhelming you think having

two nice cool fucking awesome dinosaurs

squaring off would be a fulfilling thing

to watch for both the audience and

yourself but man I imagine the NPCs or

program with disappointment based on how

bad these fights are because it's just

one animation it's one fucking animation

repeated maybe three times and that's it

fights over somebody wins and then you

carry the carcass out on a helicopter

it's it's unreal to me that there would

only be one animation for a fight where

the fight should definitely be something

cool and rewarding to see which it

absolutely isn't there's also not much

of a story here it's extremely light on

story I mean take from that what you

will I don't think anyone went in here

expecting a mind-blowing story I think

they just wanted a cool park manager

parks and with some dinosaurs and that

is kind of here - the park sim again

like I said but you will get that if

that's what you're trying to get out of

this this is a game that I think only

hardcore dinosaur fans will enjoy I

don't think there's a whole lot here for

someone that's looking for another

planet coaster or another park attack or

a unique spin on like a roller coaster

tycoon game for example I think Zoo

Tycoon had a lot deeper gameplay and a

lot more to do than this game does and

Zoo Tycoon is over a decade old at least

in Zoo Tycoon you could add a lot of

shit and decorate your Park make it look

unique

whereas in Jurassic world evolution

there is just really nothing to add

there's no way to decorate your Park

there's no way to really make your part

feel unique or alive there's no

attractions that you can put in there

really it's just a severe lack of

features and for a $60 game it's just a

fucking spit into my asshole it's just a

big meaty slap to the face of anyone who

pays full retail price for this game

because this should be a thirty or forty

dollar game tops because there's just

not a whole lot of content here but

because they slap the name Jurassic

world

they can get away with charging full

price but like I said the game is

functional and there is some fun to be

had here I know I've been shooting on it

kind of hard but it's really only

because of the price point they sell it

out it should offer a lot more it really

seems like the entire focus of the game

was on the visuals and making the

dinosaurs look the best they could and

they look fucking fantastic let me say

they look like really really good well

beyond what I was expecting and the

whole world does look very nice and the

sound design is second to none when it

comes to dinosaurs shit granted I'm no

expert and dinosaur fucking sounds or

anything but it sounds like dinosaurs

and it sounds like a world with

Dinosaurs so those are the definitely

the two highest points here but overall

it's just such a hollow game underneath

the surface a lot of the missions feel

very boring and uninspired if you can

really even call them missions in the

first place overall it's just a

disappointing experience but it does

work and there is some shit to do here

and like I said if you are a dinosaur

fan you probably will enjoy this game on

some level but you will be left wanting

more from this product let's go ahead

and plug this shit into the moist meter

I'm giving Jurassic world evolution a

60% the game runs well it looks nice it

sounds nice there's also a fun little

progression system that I also enjoyed

quite a bit and I did think some of the

managing parts of keeping the dinosaurs

happy was very unique such as diseases

and shit like that keeping the guests

satisfied while not very difficult was

still an enjoyable thing to strive for

and of course natural disasters are

always fun in these type of games which

there are here but overall an incredibly

disappointing game with a surprising

lack of features for a $60 title so so

yeah

Moist Meter | Detroit: Become Human

initiating moisture Detroit become human

as david cages latest video game and it

takes a real deep look inside the mind

of a david cage now when dealing with

the david cage no one knows it better

than David cage himself and he really

led his entire scrotum hang out here in

the wind for all to see and it really

led to a unique experience that's going

to be different for every single player

who picks up this game I've always been

kind of a fan of David cages work in

some way or another even if I didn't so

much like the game I could at least

respect it and appreciate it for what it

was however I really liked this game but

it's absolutely not without a ton and

ton of flaws the biggest thing about

Detroit become human is the amount of

choices that are available and how much

those choices impact the overall story

Jackson Andrew and I have all played

Detroit become human and all three of

our stories were entirely different from

one another mine was more aggressive

with a lot of violence and shit going on

whereas Jackson's was pretty much he

just had the main characters getting

fucked in any possible way for the sake

of peace you'd have him get run over by

any car necessary if that's what it took

where his I was the one running people

over with a car in my story and there's

just so much shit that you could choose

from that would drastically change how

it all plays out and a lot of games make

that claim but I've never seen one that

has so so so many choices like Detroit

become human has in every single scene

everything can change based on a choice

and there's so many of those choices

it's it's incredible it really makes me

want to go back and replay it to do more

choices and get different paths and I

did do that in my initial playthrough if

I wasn't so satisfied with what I chose

I actually went back and chose a whole

new set of things to lead to an entirely

different outcome I'm just absolutely

blown away by the amount of choices that

this game gives you an anything you can

choose what you eat for breakfast you

can choose how hot or cold you want in

the fucking house there is so many

things that you can choose from that

might even seem trivial on the surface

but could lead to something serious

later down the line in that story

absolutely the best part of this game

a hundred percent now let's get to some

bad parts about this game it's not

really a game it's an interactive movie

and a lot of people are gonna be very

turned off by that because there's

really not much gameplay here it all

revolves around QTEs and walking from

point A to point B on on Rails straight

lines you don't have a whole lot of

freedom of movement or gameplay it's all

about freedom of choices and there's a

ton of that shit but I totally

understand why some people would not

like that it is just basically a movie

that you can interact with and basically

choose your own adventure from and when

there is gameplay here with the walking

or the QTEs it's very clunky especially

the walking sometimes when you press a

button and a QTE

doesn't work and the walking is like

you're controlling the worlds drunkest

tank the tank itself is fucking

inebriated just fucking smashed and it

cannot go where you want it to go

without stumbling fumbling around and

leading to a really frustrating movement

now aside from the stinky movement and

lack of gameplay and even calling it

gameplay here is being very generous the

game is superb

in terms of visuals I've never seen a

game look this great all of the

animations are absolutely fucking crisp

and incredible to look at the facial

capture is incredible you can see all

types of emotions through their faces

the lip-syncing for the most part is

really great too so it really feels like

these characters are alive voice acting

is some of the best I've heard for most

of the characters there are some

characters with some awful voice acting

but for the most part I think the main

cast do a great job and now you have to

keep in mind there Android so obviously

some of the dialogue is gonna be pretty

stilted because they're not supposed to

be super human it's all about becoming

human as the title would suggest now

another thing that I also think is

absolutely fucking fantastic is the

sound design the the score all of the

sound in this game it really brings

everything to this living breathing

universe that David cage creates here it

makes it feel super alive which is nice

I have no complaints they're nothing but

compliments for that entire Department

of audio but now I want to get back into

some shit that needs to be criticized

the writing gets really bad at points

just absolutely abominable but you would

expect that from a game with so much

dial

in all of it revolving around talking to

each other in choices but sometimes the

writing is just some of the worst I've

seen in a game and there's a lot of shit

that happens for no reason or things

that happen just to happen over no with

absolutely no justification and they're

never touched on again or explained it's

just all over the place with writing but

when it's good it's great and when it's

bad man it's some fucking b-movie awful

VHS tape shit that you don't even want

to listen to but the best thing I can

say about Detroit become human the

absolute best way to sum up the entire

game and the entire experience is

Detroit become human is absolutely

fantastic to laugh at and to play so all

this being said let's pop this shit into

the moist meter

I'm giving Detroit become human a 70%

the game is probably some of the most

fun I've had streaming i streamed the

whole thing and it was really enjoyable

because it really is a very fun game to

poke holes in and make fun of and also

just to get taken back by how great the

environment is and just to experience a

very unique story that's going to be

different for every single player that

picks up the controller on this one so

yeah overall Detroit become human is

definitely David cages best mess that's

it so yeah

Moist Meter | Solo: A Star Wars Story

initiating moisture there aren't enough

words in the human languages to

accurately convey just how surprised I

am that this solo a Star Wars movie

turned out to be as good as it is I was

incredibly ready to just write this

movie off I was fully expecting to this

just to just be a fucking urethral swab

of a movie experience I expected this to

be horrible and it was so far from that

I'd like to quickly touch on one of my

biggest moisture meter regrets it was

the Star Wars last Jedi review I did I

gave that too high of a score 100% and I

fully apologized I just kind of was

wrapped up in the hype of it seeing

movies when they opened is always a more

fun experience and it makes the movies

better than they are that movie did not

deserve the score I gave it it should

have been much lower than a 70 I just

didn't like it I rewatched it recently

it's just not a good movie in my opinion

so Disney has shown to me that they

can't really make a good Star Wars movie

in my opinion until this movie solo is

spectacular and it had so much bad shit

going on with the production of this

movie that I don't know how they could

make it as good as they did here there's

definitely some shortcomings and I'll

touch on those real quick right now the

biggest misstep with this movie your

biggest complaint I would have about

this is there's really just not a whole

lot of depth to Han Solo they don't

really develop this character there's

really just no character development at

all in this movie with pretty much any

of the characters there's a couple where

there is some development but not that

much nothing like super crazy all-in-all

this movie just strived to be a fun

adventure movie showing you Han Solo and

beloved characters doing some cool shit

with very few hard Star Wars tie-ins

they're not like jerking your dick off

with Star Wars cameos and tie-ins but

they are here but that wasn't the focal

point the focal point was making a fun

standalone movie with an enjoyable plot

that wasn't convoluted or thrown in with

a lot of unnecessary useless plot ploys

with that are just lazy writing it was

just really enjoyable

Julie I think it's the best Star Wars

movie I've seen the settings were great

the visuals were great the sound was

super fucking spectacular the character

designs the character designs are the

best in the entire franchise I saw a lot

of new aliens here I've never seen

before and they looked fucking cool

you'd have aliens it looked like five

titty stacked on top of each other with

a Rubik's Cube in the middle there is

some really cool looking alien species

in here and really just all of this shit

in here was cool-looking they had like a

space yacht that was really good really

really good to look at I mean I just

have so few complaints about this and I

can't believe that because this this is

a movie I think almost everyone rolled

their eyes at oh here's Disney milking

Star Wars and by all means they

absolutely are by making this movie but

goddamn the attempts of humor in this

movie were fucking awful as well just

insufferable attempts to make you laugh

but I don't think anyone will laugh at

at least the theater I went to no one

did the half-full theater for a Star

Wars release which is the first time

I've ever seen that happen so the last

Jedi succeeded in one area which is

making everyone hate Disney Star Wars

movies for good reason but this is

definitely their best one another bad

thing about this movie is the characters

they also go with the same tired out

theme of rebellion with youngsters it's

just that's just so played out and just

you know just something you got to roll

your eyes at because you expect that you

get it and it's kind of just

underwhelming when you do and the droid

l 3-3-7

leat gamer speak elite nerds if any does

anyone else nerd in the early 2000s leat

the worst character in the Star Wars

franchise beating Jar Jar Binks by a

fucking mile that's just a really bad

character no matter how no matter how

you look at it l 337 is a horrible

fucking character I don't know how

anyone could defend it

okay the Droid was just awful awful

droid really just not fun to watch on

the screen they really milk some

beautiful premium nectar from this bitch

here they absolutely nailed this movie

it's the best Disney Star Wars they've

made so far and which is incredible

because it's like I said they've had a

lot of production problems here I don't

know how they managed to squeak this one

out of their assholes but they did it's

a very clean non stinky product someone

that was working on this must have

gathered all the Dragon Balls and made a

wish Hey look

Shenron I've got this real shit heap of

a movie can we go ahead and turn this

dumpster fire into something spectacular

Shin run said no he doesn't have that

kind of power but we can turn it into

something pretty goddamn good and they

did this is pretty goddamn good it's

nothing that you're gonna have to go out

and see but for your Star Wars fan

I think you absolutely should see this

because it's the best Disney one so far

it's really fucking good I have so few

complaints about it but there is some

nitpicky things that I could pick apart

but it'd be spoilers you really do have

to suspend your disbelief in a lot of

these parts cuz apparently everyone

understands how to fly every ship ever

made and everyone is so incredibly

technical tech savvy that they can fix

anything and understand every order

given in a ship they've never seen

before so there's a lot of shit you have

to just be like okay you know what

that's fine I'll just let that slide

there's also a lot of people complaining

that they didn't really stay true to the

Han Solo character they missed a lot of

why he was such a big character and an

important one and why everyone liked him

and I can agree to a certain extent but

Alden nailed it that was the best

casting choice for this they could have

made he did capture Han Solo as well as

anyone possibly could and he already

knew Donald Glover was gonna nail it cuz

he just he shits out perfection these

days he's just great let's go ahead and

plug this shit into the moist meter I'm

gonna give it an 80% it really is the

best Disney Star Wars it is really good

it's very entertaining but keep in mind

it is just an adventure movie at the end

of the day they don't really try and

make some huge impact on the Star Wars

universe or really add a whole lot to

Star Wars

they just very clearly wanted to make a

fun adventure movie with some beloved

characters and have a self-contained

story that was not affected too much by

anything in any other Star Wars or

really have that much of a fan effect on

anything Star Wars related except for

obviously Han Solo and Chewbacca and

Londo but it is a very very fun movie to

watch it is really just so goddamn

surprising how good this movie is most

people are writing it off rightfully so

I did as well but I think it is worth

seeing it's a good movie so yeah

Moist Meter: Deadpool 2

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today I'll be analyzing the

moisture content found within the new

Deadpool movie if I was in a desert

dying of thirst and you showed me

Deadpool - and gave me no beverages with

the wetness of this movie alone hydrate

me and allow me to survive you're about

to find out I'm of the few people that

thought the first Deadpool wasn't a

masterpiece I thought it was a good

movie I thought it was a very good movie

at times but I didn't think it was like

this magnum opus of r-rated comedy to

usher in a new age of boners I thought

it was just a good movie but I can say

with confidence that Deadpool 2 is

significantly better than the first and

it's among a very short list of comedy

movies that actually make me laugh

really hard in the theaters and the

action in this one is a lot better than

the first so it's a great comedy it's a

great action it's a nutsack with both

testicles in it which is what you want

my biggest complaint about the movie is

the first 30 or so minutes of it it's

just over filled with references that

start to lose their luster and it I

think it really boils down to them

trying way too hard to emulate

everything the first movie did all the

way down to the opening credits having

the same kind of shit made by these

people with small asses from the

visionary director of the last time I

ejaculated just kind of shit like that

and it makes you roll your eyes because

you'd seen it before and it seems like

they were just really trying hard to do

that again it doesn't land very well I

think in the first 30 or so minutes it's

a bit stinky but the second the x-force

gets together the movie becomes

absolutely amazing from that point all

the way till the credits roll everything

just starts to click and the movie gets

this momentum that it never really loses

all of the new characters they introduce

are all really good except for in my

opinion the main kid fire Pfister or

fire fist what it will fire fist or fire

fist it's all kind of the same action

it's it's fisting with fire yeah I

didn't think his character was all that

great or super fleshed out or anything

he was just kind of like an angry kid

and he was just always angry until he

just wasn't angry I didn't think he was

a great character but all the others

domino kay

Peter damn near stole the show all of

them just so fuckin good I really think

this movie just has something for any

audience member if you're going to watch

some action and has a ton of action all

of it really good you're going to laugh

it has some great jokes some really

clever zingers and humdingers now not

all of them are gonna land obviously not

all of them are gonna be a nice lap or a

gutbuster or have you ringing up your

mom during the movie to say god damn mom

I'm laughing real hard but a lot of them

do land and they're really well done

jokes and they have really great gags I

just think the whole movie is just so

well put together once the x-force gets

together before that it's a bit sloppy

and stinky like I said but after that

everything works super fucking well the

soundtrack is one thing that I'd really

like to make a note of because it

impressed me so much the soundtrack is

fantastic splendid spectacular second

only to the annihilation soundtrack

which is my favorite movie soundtrack

it's not quite to that level I'm

exaggerating but it's a great soundtrack

but anihilation soundtrack will always

be better it's it's a great fucking

soundtrack and they have this really

great orchestral piece they made for the

movie that I can't talk about because

it'll spoil some spoil some story shit

but it's a great orchestral piece that I

think anyone will appreciate when they

hear it in the scenes that it's in

there's one more problem that I need to

point out and I don't have an

explanation for why the movies like this

but it points the movie has some

downright fucking abominable CGI just

some abysmal stinky shit CGI out of

nowhere that looks like it was made in

Unity game engine it's actually like a

video game cutscene that didn't fully

load and it didn't render all the models

textures properly so you're left with

like this and texture 'less husk of an

object that's not believable at all it

would have been better if they just did

like a Deadpool cran drawing in place of

some of that CGI it was really fucking

bad sometimes for no reason at all just

an explicable jarring and distracting

but I mean it's still a very good movie

let's go ahead and plug this shit into

the moist meter

I'm giving Deadpool to an 80-percent

this should have been much higher I want

to give it a 90 because I laughed harder

in this movie than pretty much any other

comedy I can think of in a movie

and the whole audience was constantly

laughing not every joke landed like I

said but the majority of them did hit

and they hit really hard with the

audience and me personally sometimes

it's a great fucking movie and I think

it has something for pretty much

everyone to enjoy if you want good

action you'll get it here you want good

comedy you'll get it here it's also got

this incredible showdown between two

iconic x-men characters that if you are

a fan of comic books or superheroes in

general you've probably been waiting to

see unfold on the big screen and it's

beautiful to watch but even that kind of

gets the unfortunate treatment of bad

CGI during the fight I really don't know

why the CGI got so bad sometimes that is

a huge bummer but the movie is still

fucking fantastic that's it so yeah

Moist Meter: Bad Samaritan

initiating moisture protocol bad

Samaritan bad Silurian bad scare Egan

bad salmon bad marketing I guarantee

you've never heard of the movie bad

Samaritan because there was no marketing

for it at all this movie was dead on

arrival it is in the top 10 lowest

grossing opening weekend's ever it's

number 8 it grossed 1.7 million on so

far and that's that's abominable usually

when I go to see a new movie the

conversation my girlfriend and I have is

should we get tickets ahead of time like

what if they're sold out where what if

the seats are shitty the conversation we

had this time is are they even bothering

to sell tickets to this movie have they

even heard of it are they showing it

this movie I have never heard of until I

looked online to see what was playing

and I saw a bad Samaritan I assumed it

was like a Bollywood movie translation

or something because like I said I

genuinely heard nothing about this

despite it actually having some talent

in this movie like some decent-sized

names and it's it's a shame because this

is a good fucking movie in a nutshell

the movie revolves around a thief who

works as a valet he steals someone's

card robs their house but while robbing

it he finds that he has a prisoner a

woman and then it becomes a mission to

save that woman and becomes a game of

condom cat-and-mouse and it's really

good it's good it actually is really

good now there's still a lot of problems

with this movie it really drags in some

points and the pacing can sometimes get

a little weird but that's not a huge

hindrance the acting is fantastic and

all the characters are really well

fleshed out in this movie it really

takes everything logical that movies

just throw out and just you have to

suspend your disbelief like why didn't

the character do this or act this way

this movie calls it out for instance

when he first comes across the girl he

made a silly decision and then his

friend said why the fuck didn't you do

this and his excuse made a lot of sense

is he was panicking he didn't know when

the guy was gonna be home it's like okay

well that's that's rational I understand

that and it does that a couple of times

throughout this movie there's still some

bad decisions made but for the most part

everything is very logical and if a bad

decision is made

justify it really well which I have a

lot of respect for it's basically

calling out the elephant in the room for

having a small wiener and it's just a

refreshing movie really because it's

just a classic thriller it doesn't

reinvent the wheel there's nothing super

crazy about this movie it just does by

the numbers well and that's nice it was

nice to see especially going into this

with no expectations cuz I didn't even

know what it was about I wouldn't be

surprised that there's not a single

trailer of this movie on YouTube which

is a shame because it is good and I feel

like this movie would have done well

with most audiences because it's just

well executed the tense moments are very

tense and the main complaints I have are

gun it gets a little goofy in the second

part like the middle part of the movie

it becomes a plot of revenge but it's

very petty revenge it's like I'm

breaking up with you girlfriend bitch

and here's a titty picture sent around

it's that's that was kind of silly to

watch that wasn't very cool or scary or

anything I get why it's there but it was

just still a very silly segment but

overall the movies just super solid it's

not really any twists and turns or

anything it's just it's just a matter of

catching the guy and saving the girl and

not getting everyone around you killed

solid movie let's plug this shit into

the moist meter I'm giving this a 70% my

main problems with the movie revolve

around the dragging in certain points

and also there are some silly scenes in

here and in addition to that there's

also some shit where you really do need

to suspend your disbelief because it

seems like there was some very easy ways

of catching the guy almost immediately

that weren't addressed but very solid

overall it's worth seeing I'd be very

surprised if this movie even got over 5

million overall and its whole run

because there is no marketing for this

even walking through the theater where

they have every single movie playing

with posters there was no poster for bad

Samaritan and unsurprisingly my

girlfriend and I were the only ones in

the theatre it's a shame but it's a good

movie that's a yeah

Moist Meter | Avengers: Infinity War

moisture protocol welcome to the moist

meter today we'll be analyzing the

wetness found in the New Avengers movie

infinity war this is the third Avengers

movie the second being age of Ultron

which was a huge stinky diaper of a

movie just a big old shit stain if the

if your wife had invited age of ultron

over when you were at work and she had

sex with the movie age of ultron you

would forget that your wife ever cheated

on you that movie is so fucking

forgettable it's disgusting it's a

really not good movie and I had very low

expectations for this one and I'm really

happy to say I was extremely surprised

with this it is extremely good the best

superhero movie I've seen easily now the

plots pretty simple after a lot of

failed attempts from Thanos to get the

Infinity stones he decides to come in

person raw no rubber nuts to butts to

get the Infinity stones himself and he

is one hell of a big bad I love that

they didn't just make him this comically

evil a character that no one gives a

fuck about because he will not no one

gives a fuck about but no one can

sympathize with no one can you know

rationalize what they're doing they

really flesh them out and humanized him

with motives that some people might even

say were just and might even support

what Thanos was attempting to do and I

really liked that it was a villain that

you could really feel for and even at

times root for a very human villain but

still a villain and a real fucking

badass this is how you do a big bad and

a movie fantastic absolutely spectacular

villain I really really enjoyed them

I really enjoyed him a lot but let's get

to the things that I didn't enjoy about

this movie I hated what they did with

the Hulk it was this it was just so

yucky what they did with the Hulk they

made the Hulk the biggest pussy in the

Marvel Cinematic Universe and I thought

maybe at the end it'd be redemption for

the whole can you come out and have his

big shining moment it was a super badass

but that didn't happen

they just made the Hulk laughable and

just really upsetting kind of a spit in

the face to Hulk fans in my opinion

because there was no reason for it they

didn't justify why the Hulk is all of a

sudden afraid of his own shadow

they didn't justify why the Hulk is just

not anything cool anymore it

just there's no reason for him to be so

pathetic it would be better if they had

Peter from the new Deadpool movie

trailer you know who has no superpowers

but still skydives he would have done

more in this movie than the Hulk does

fucking sad honestly because the Hulk's

one of the best characters another thing

I really didn't like is the heroes never

really out play their opponents or out

strength them or really beat them all

the big bad guys they kill like the

lieutenant's the captains and stuff with

the Pharaohs whose army they killed him

by stabbing them in the back or

ambushing them from behind they just get

them when they're not expecting that

they catch them with their pants down

and that's not really heroic or really

cool to watch it's like oh well I mean

you just kind of fucking cheated they're

even 1v1 zone call of duty modern

warfare 2 on rust had more integrity to

them this is just kind of a letdown when

they kill some kill one of the bad guys

or something like that there's also a

lot of pacing issues with the movie

because there's so many characters each

doing their own little separate

storyline to tie back into getting it

Thanos so there's a lot of pacing issues

here

not a huge complaint but it is a

complaint nonetheless because that is an

issue there's also a lot of really silly

plot moments that just make no sense and

are really stupid but it's a superhero

movie you can expect that kind of shit

to happen now know what this movie does

right is everything else the humor in

this movie is very reminiscent a Thor

Ragnarok which is really good so the

humor was on point for the most part

it's a for a few lackluster stinky ones

they tossed in there but overall humor

was great the visuals per usual with a

Marvel movie spectacular really good the

fighting scenes were really interesting

because it have the reality bending

stuff with Doctor Strange and also the

Infinity stones being tossed in there so

it wasn't just you know slap fighting or

like jerking off each other until

someone comes and that's the end of the

fight or anything there was a whole lot

of different new ways of fighting

because there's the Infinity stones at

play there's magic at play and all the

heroes using all their powers and shit

really really cool to watch a lot of the

fights unfold at least up until the end

of the fight when one of the other

heroes runs up behind the enemy and ties

their shoelaces together tended another

great thing about this movie is the

ending best ending in a superhero movie

I've seen I

respect the shit out of what they did

there they actually pulled the trigger

on some really important character

deaths don't know if they're gonna stay

that because there's going to be the

sequel to this movie coming out next

year obviously but as it stands I'm

really satisfied with what they did at

the end they they committed to a sad

unhappy ending which is very

uncharacteristic of modern superhero

movies I know DC kind of takes cum shots

in the dark to try and make their movies

very grim and sad but they're usually

not they're just laughably bad for the

most part but this one actually did have

a very you know sad ending and I'd like

to shout out Tom Hollands acting cuz

that dude is killing it if you're

watching this Tom Holland come on the

podcast I want to tell you right to your

face that you're fucking great actor

best spider-man I used to believe that

Tobey Maguire was the best spider-man

until this movie Tom Holland you've sold

me man you're the best spider-man you're

the real Spidey

I really can't gush enough about this

movie because it really does everything

a superhero movie should do and it does

it really well save for a few pretty big

issues with pacing and other things I've

mentioned but it's still a complete

package that I think anyone who's

followed Marvel movies will really enjoy

and really like the payoff I don't think

you'll like what they've done with the

Hulk in to an extent star-lord but

everything else is right on point and

all the characters really shine now

let's go ahead and plug this shit into

the moist meter I'm gonna give this an

88% that's a bit of an arbitrary number

but I want to let it be clear that it's

the highest superhero movie score I've

tossed out because I think this is the

best superhero movie I've seen but I

don't think it's quite like a 90%

moisture meter movie I think it's just

below that because it does have quite a

few issues but it is phenomenal

absolutely phenomenal and I am beyond

shocked at how great it is and I don't

think I've looked forward to a movie in

a long time like I have right now for an

infinity War part 2 or whatever the fuck

they're gonna call it I'm really really

fucking excited to see how this wraps up

so yeah that's it

so yeah

Moist Meter: God of War

you see any moisture protocol welcome to

the moist meter today I'll be analyzing

the moisture content found within the

new god of war game this game has been

hyped beyond all games in 2018 and

people are too afraid to say anything

negative about it but not the brave

scientists at moist meter headquarters

but goddammit there's not a lot of

negative things about this game this

game is fucking phenomenal it really

does deserve most of the praise it's

getting however I'm gonna get my biggest

complaint about this game out of the way

right now

I fucking hate its title I hate this

recent trend where you put a new entry

in the series with the same name as the

first entry in the series it's fucking

lazy it's silly and understand the

pretentious answer from the people that

love the smell their own farts hole also

reinvented Kratos he's not the same man

as we saw in the previous god award

games most it should have a completely

different title as if soft reboot it's

fucking stupid it's fucking stupid call

it God over for call it God award Norse

call it God of War hard dick no condom I

don't really care but don't call it the

same name as the first game in the

series it's just dumb it's very flat-out

stupid and silly it'd be like if I had a

son I named him Charlie but it wasn't

Charlie jr. you could not call him

Charlie jr. cuz that's not his name it's

just Charlie so I would be Charlie 1994

and he'd be Charlie whatever year he'd

be born and it's dumb it's really

fucking dumb no matter how you look at

it but this game is fucking amazing so

it revolves around Kratos and his son at

Reyes at races just his nickname his

real name is boy and they go on a really

emotional adventure and from that

adventure it starts off pretty innocent

where the mother dies and they just want

to scatter the ashes but from that it

evolves into this really big an

expanding plot that is just so

captivating and super fun and I just

absolutely love the story here it's

delivered so well and the relationship

between father and boy is constantly

evolving and you start to really feel

for both characters and it's just really

really amazingly well written and well

delivered the voice acting is top-notch

as well especially from Christopher

judge whose voice now haunts my dreams

that man can make any man feel lesser

just by his voice just listening to that

boom

sultry voice deliver really well-written

lines just plucks hair off of your

nutsack because you don't deserve them

because you don't sound like Christopher

judge so it's just really well done

across the board but Christopher judges

performance really stood out to me now

my favorite thing about this game is

definitely the visuals the visuals are

just breathtaking the world that's built

here is massive and it's incredible to

just explore and have fun and and it's

very very big full of fucking content

two side quests if you want to deviate

from the main story path and I would

recommend doing that because they're

very interesting side quests it's not

just go jerk off six cows in a field a

mile away and come back to me it's hey

we got a lot of shit to do here I don't

want to spoil anything and even the

slightest but it's really well done it's

not a big world that's the void of

content and even the traveling from

location to location is fun because boy

starts talking about the world and

expanding the lore and asking kratos

questions and which keeps involving the

relationship it's just really great all

around I was I was amazed that it wasn't

just tedious going from spot to spot

because I was really interested in the

stories that were being told on the boat

and the stories on the boat were

actually some of the best in the game in

my opinion and maybe that's just because

I'm interested in mythology and shit but

it wasn't really boring stuff at all it

wasn't like hey Kratos did you hear

about you know the guy I didn't like

green eggs and ham these stories were

like some high-octane and really

interesting shit it's and it also kind

of foreshadowed what we might see in

other God of War entries because this is

going to be more than just one game and

that was fun because I feel like it

paying attention to those stories from

boy on the boat might even come in handy

another thing that almost made me cum in

my hand is the soundtrack the soundtrack

is sparingly used but when it is it

really steals the show and makes a

cinematic scene amazing it really bumps

it up to the next level when I say it's

sparingly used it's not like that's a

game devoid of music or score or

anything it's just oftentimes it's not

the focal point it fades into the

background during combat or during a

exposition moment but when it is front

and center

holy shit does it really capture you and

bring you into the moment and then that

brings us to the combat which to my

surprise was really deep and fun that

was my biggest concern

with this game when I was watching the

reviews and reading about it it's just

the combat looked very dull and slow but

to my surprise it's far from that it's

actually very deep the comboing is very

fun and fulfilling and there's a lot of

wiggle room here to play around with

your own unique play styles which I

didn't expect at all now that being said

you don't really need to you can kind of

get through every enemy in this game

using just the most basic of combos and

special abilities your runic abilities

you don't really need to think outside

of the box to beat the enemies they

don't really challenge you to approach

things differently but that might just

be from playing on the normal difficulty

or hard difficulty I didn't experience

any type of unique ways to approach the

combat on either of those difficulties

but maybe if you go a bit higher you

will need to think a bit harder and what

you do but regardless even if you don't

need to it's still fun to use all of the

skills and abilities at your disposal

because it's fulfilling and it does help

a lot to defeat the enemies faster but

you don't really need to which is fine

that's not really a complaint but what

is a complaint is the enemy design I

think the enemy design for the most part

is very uninspired it's just some

generic looking zombies and trolls and

ogres for the most part there are some

unique enemies here though there's some

werewolf enemies as well as some other

ones on some side quests that are really

well designed but the main chunk of the

enemies you fight aren't going to be all

that visually stunning or unique they

look like something you'd find in every

other hack and slash game ever made

which is kind of disappointing that's

not really a huge negative because it's

still super fun to beat the shit and

piss out of these enemies another thing

that kind of caught me off guard was how

fun it was to be collecting gear and

looking for gear and trying to get your

stats where you want him to be that

actually made quite a bit of difference

in the combat in the gameplay and I

didn't expect that I thought it all

basically just be aesthetics but it

really did influence the way that your

character played out and having boys

shoot arrows when you want him to and

summon runic summons to attack as well

there was a lot of strategy behind it

and there was a lot of planning that

went into getting the gear and the stats

where you wanted him to be to suit your

playstyle one other complaint that I

have though is a lot of the puzzle

sections and a lot of the slower bits

where you were running from point A to

point B not travel

by boat really dragged on there's a lot

of sections in this game that I felt

could have been shortened in order to

help with the pacing because sometimes

the pacing just comes to a screeching

halt and you get a little bored with

solving the same fucking puzzle for the

up team time and that's that's kind of

an issue I have here now it's not a huge

issue it doesn't detract from my overall

enjoyment of the game it's just the

pacing is kind of wonky when it hits

that kind of shit now it's time to plug

this shit into the 100% gluten-free and

vegan moisture content analyzing meter

we're giving this an 85 percent the game

is absolutely fucking fantastic no

matter how you look at it a world that

can absolutely draw you in a lot of lore

should you choose to want to learn all

of it a ton of content and challenge

modes and shit if you want to keep

playing the game after the credits roll

all I think there's a lot of

replayability here so after one

playthrough you'll probably want to go

explore and learn everything else there

is and it's just a very great game

overall with a few flaws but I do think

the majority of people including God of

War fans are gonna really like this game

but one other thing I'd like to mention

is after the first boss battle nothing

really reaches that level of holy shit

again it really kind of loses that steam

after the first boss battle all the

other cinematics and boss battles can't

even come close to the first encounter

it is such an amazing boss battle and

such an amazing and long fuckin fun

fight that nothing else in the game was

able to match that which is a shame but

it doesn't mean all the other shit and

all the other boss battles weren't fun

they were they just were not to the same

level as the first one I just like to

make that very clear because god damn it

I really fell in love after that first

fucking boss battle and the scenes that

followed and it's really a shame that

the rest couldn't get up to that level

again but it was fucking great from

start to finish and I think many people

most people will really like this game

that's it yeah

Moist Meter: Rampage

initiating moisture protocol welcome to

the moist meter where we're all

surprised the video game movie wasn't a

massive pile of shit the movie I'm

talking about his rampage if you didn't

read the title of the video the movie is

based on a game series of the same name

I only ever played the rampage for the

n64 and I fucking loved it as a kid

and this movie really captures a lot of

the spirit of the game in my opinion

there's even a few Easter eggs in there

if you like to jerk off to some

callbacks and cameos and such now the

movie story it's it's very simple an

evil organization creates a pathogen

spacestation explodes which has the

pathogen pathogen and it drops three of

them into some animals areas right to

their fucking doorstep like a blue apron

delivery they inhale the pathogen and it

makes them super aggressive and super

big they start destroying Chicago and

it's up to the rock and his sidekick to

save the day and that's really about the

whole the whole premise of the movie

they got to stop the evil corporation

and stop the rampaging monsters the

movies really surprisingly good it's

very fun that's it's a word I don't like

to toss around but I can't help but toss

it around sometimes because it does

describe movies like this where it's not

trying to reinvent the condom here it's

just trying to deliver something that is

entertaining for the time it's on screen

it's not gonna make you stop and reflect

him you know what if these animals

really were 500 feet tall what would we

do what would be the protocol I can't I

can't hold my god it's gonna keep me up

at night it doesn't make you think on

anything morally or anything but it's

just a very fun movie to watch you're

watching some giant fucking monsters

destroys shit and it's fun and you're

watching the world's most entertaining

actor the rock the rock really deserves

all the success he's been getting in the

last decade or so the man is just super

fuckin fun to watch on screen every role

he gets he turns it into a likeable role

I'm not saying every movie he's been in

has been a great movie or anything but

even the movies that are bad are never

bad because of him he's never weighed

down a movie he's always been a very

positive part of any project he's put

his fucking face on it's amazing

it really is and that continues here you

just fucking great in this movie doing

if you're watching this you're great

actor man you're welcome to come on the

podcast so I can tell you that right to

your face but yeah so I mean the movie

visually is really fun to watch too the

fights when the monsters are fighting

and blowing shit up and there's fighting

and shit everything it's very easy to

follow unlike a lot of other big monster

movies and even the new Pacific Rim had

this problem where you can't exactly

tell what's going on transformers is the

biggest culprit and fucking that shit up

because it just looks like to dump

trucks that are hitting each other and

it's very boring to watch those movies

except the first Pacific Rim they did it

well but this one does it well too you

can always tell what's going on and its

really cinematic it's it feels like it

has a lot of weight behind it it feels

satisfying to watch them fucking

destroys shit and pummel each other

really just super fun to watch on the

screen I will say the plot isn't super

great but it's not like a focal point

either it moves really fast it doesn't

weigh you down with all the details and

convoluting itself or anything like that

it's very simple and it really just puts

the spotlight on the action and you know

getting the the monsters under control

and solving that situation really it's

been it was executed super fucking well

because a lot of movies have the problem

where they take the focus off of that

like the new Pacific Rim and they put it

on a bad story or an uninteresting story

and that didn't matter here at all

everything super well paced and just

very nicely done and really enjoyed it

surprisingly that being said I don't

think it's like a go out in must-see

movie so let's plug that shit into the

moist meter I'm gonna give it a 65

percent very enjoyable but with its

obvious flaws there's clear plot holes

who gives a fuck there's also some slow

scenes but who gives a fuck because it

gets made up for the point I'm making is

it's not a movie that is going to be one

that just leaves your jaw on the floor

it's gonna be a movie we're like yeah

fuck yeah that gorilla just hit that

giant crocodile what the fuck yeah oh

shit yeah you know just one of those

type of hype up movies that are fun to

watch and that's all it aim to be and it

did it just fine so that's it so

Moist Meter: A Quiet Place

initiating moisture protocol welcome to

the moist meter and just a quiet place

it's fucking spectacular I just want to

get right into this mainstream horror

movies have sucked asshole for the last

decade non-debatable the horror movies

have been so copy and pasted so

cookie-cutter just this overuse

fleshlight that just been pounded by

director after director leaving you with

the same shit every single time the same

load basically it's just so boring to

see a mainstream horror movie these days

for the most part a few exceptions here

and there but overall horror movies are

awful a quiet place however is a nice

queef of fresh air it's an interesting

premise that's executed flawlessly so

the movie revolves around one family

struggled to survive against creatures

that hunt purely by sound so they can't

make any noise at all thus the title a

quiet place they're really good at

hearing things they could probably

fucking hear your thoughts they're

really good hunters so it's really

important that they never make noise and

that is so fucking incredible to see on

screen and the biggest complaint most

people have about modern horror movies

are the stupid characters they're always

the dumbest fucking group of

Neanderthals you've ever seen on screen

but in this movie they're extremely

intelligent making very smart choices

throughout the entire film they live on

a farm that they've outfitted with

really smart contraptions and setups

they have a warning system of things

aren't going right they've put sand all

over the fucking place and they walk

barefoot so when you walk over the sand

you don't make as much noise they play

board games using fabric instead of the

pieces they eat off leaves instead of

plates everything they do is really

smart really well done and I just loved

seeing that it was such a unique world

to watch and it was always super fun to

see what kind of measures they had in

place for things going wrong or how they

dealt with getting food or all kinds of

different shit and it was really fucking

smart and the acting was phenomenal

that's not something I usually give a

shit about but even me even I was able

to recognize how incredible these

performances were so that speaks volumes

to how well they did the movie does an

incredible job of constantly building

tension just when you thought you've

reached the climax you real

you just getting started it's about to

get even more tense it's so well done

there's some scares here and there so

it's actually a competent horror movie

as well not just the thriller it's just

so fucking good I have so few complaints

about this movie the only complaints you

can really make are nitpicky ones such

as how can they still have electricity

because obviously they'd still need a

generator or something which would make

a lot of noise and it's never really an

explanation on where the electricity

comes from you'd also have other type of

logical inconsistencies well what about

things you can't control like a sneeze

or a fart they'd hear that and they'd

immediately come and then definitely

suboptimal way of going out that'd be

fucking embarrassing you died because

your asshole burped but the point is if

you go super deep into it yeah you can

poke holes into the movie but you'd miss

the point it's not what it's about its

presenting this beautiful world how they

live in it and all the smart decisions

that were made throughout in order to

survive I will say a complaint that I do

have that I think is a reasonable one is

the weakness of the monsters it's really

obvious I don't think it's gonna catch

anyone by surprise what their weaknesses

and just really I feel like that would

have been the first means of attack the

characters would have tried against the

monsters but still that's not that big

of a deal you needed some type of way to

fight them I just wish they could have

figured out something a little bit

better

but that being said it's still fun to

watch them exploit that weakness towards

the end of the movie when they discover

it another minor complaint I have is I

think the monster just looks kind of

fucking goofy it looks like Slenderman

if he was a dog made out of blades not

to spoil anything but that's that's what

it looked like it was just kind of goofy

to look at it was still really effective

like it was a horrifying thing when you

saw it walking around it's like ah shit

it's it's about to you know

Hulkamania is about to run wild up in

this bitch now but I just thought the

design of it could have been better it

wasn't horrible or anything it just

wasn't super great but the movie overall

is definitely the best horror movie I've

seen in theaters in the last decade

hands down absolutely no fucking contest

so let's plug this shit into the moist

meter I'm giving this a 90 percent this

is a really great thriller a really good

horror movie it's just a nice breath of

fresh air it's just super fucking great

it really is worth seeing if you like

horror movies or thrillers whatever it's

just a fucking great movie it's a short

movie it doesn't

overstay its welcome and it does a great

job of conveying a story without using a

whole lot of words you really understand

the characters even though there's very

little dialogue in this movie such a

great fucking movie that's it

so yeah

Moist Meter: Tomb Raider

initiating moisture protocol for

thousands of years many men and women

have gone searching for the ancient

treasure the treasure of pure moisture

still haven't found it but we're looking

in movies and in video games mainly

movies because a lot of the video games

coming out I'm just not super interested

in but I did see the new tomb raider so

how what is it you're asking well it's a

little damp actually it's not bad as far

as video game movies go this is probably

one of the better ones I've ever seen

it's very competently made it's nothing

spectacular now don't don't get me wrong

it has plenty of flaws it's nothing

where you'll be sitting in your seat and

just fire back because it's caught you

by surprised how good it is you're not

gonna lean over and tap a stranger salt

shoulder and offer to give them a hand

job because you're so excited by how

great it is but it's a good enough movie

where you'll sit there and be

entertained for the roughly two hours

it's on I will say the main character

the main lead actress Alicia vikander is

perhaps the best fit for Laura Croft

possible and the game really emulates

the video game excuse me the movie

really emulates the video game

characters movements to a tee that's

movies based pretty closely to the 2013

Tomb Raider reboot game that came out

and it's a really faithful adaptation a

lot of the same visual elements

translate it even has the old rusty

plane even some of the injuries Laura

gets in this movie happened in that game

so if you like the game you'll most

likely like to see this movie well

you'll like the movie if you see it not

likely to you know you understand what

the fuck I'm saying you don't come in to

mind dojo and say hey you fucked it up

but I did and I can admit that and I'm

sorry yeah I'm saying you'll probably

like the movie if you like the game

that's the point I'm trying to get

across there another really good

positive thing I can say about this

movie is the director he has a great

name it's I think it's pronounced roar

ooh THOG he sounds like an orc you'd

encounter in middle-earth it's a great

fucking name keep up the great work whoo

thug the story's simple enough laura

Crofts father has been missing for a

long time she doesn't want to accept

she's dead so when she finally gets a

hint that he might still be alive she

goes off on her very first adventure to

try and find him he's been diving into

the supernatural shit he's been watching

a lot of sci-fi channel and he wants to

try and find the

Queen of Death Himiko very similar to

Rugrats kimiko I'm guessing that's not a

coincidence at all roar ooh thought

would not dabble in coincidences

everything is cold and calculated a very

nice shout-out to Rugrats with the

naming there now let's go into some of

the flaws here a lot of the stuff in

this movie is just kind of nonsensical

there's a lot of decisions that get made

that don't really add up and least in my

opinion and there's a lot of scenes that

I don't feel serve a purpose especially

the intro scene I just thought it was

really fucking goofy it was a bike chase

with paint pouring out and there's like

a game of tag on bikes and it just it

was stupid to look at it it looked like

something I'd see in machs cables big

move or some other Nickelodeon movie it

served no purpose other than to

establish hey look this is a girl doing

masculine testosterone-driven things

like riding a bike with paint pouring

out what the fuck did you know a girl

could do that goddamn this is goofy and

there's a couple more scenes like that

but the biggest one that stood out to me

but overall the movie like I said is

competent it's got flaws but it's still

a fun adventure movie there's not a lot

of adventure movies that get made better

in this style like this one which is

kind of like Indiana Jones in a way and

to me those are kind of my favorite

movies like as you know the mummy is my

favorite movie it's followed closely by

my second favorite movie The Mummy

Returns because it's an adventure movie

through and through it doesn't really

try and reinvent the wheel it doesn't

try and push boundaries or anything it

just plays by the numbers but it's a fun

adventure movie and that's kind of what

this is I wouldn't even compare this to

the mummy of The Mummy Returns because

those are untouchable movies modern

works of art masterpieces magnum opus is

but this movie is still a good adventure

movie and a lot of them don't get made

so when I see one I get pretty excited

and I was excited to see this one it was

surprising cuz didn't expect to like it

that much because video game movies

typically wreck them real hard but this

is pretty fucking good for a video game

adaptation the acting on some of the

characters isn't very good so you enough

to excuse some of that and like I said

there's some goofball scenes but other

than that visually appealing stories

simple to follow

that's not convoluted and it's not too

bad there's really not much else to say

so I'm just gonna plug this shit into

the moisture meter now I'm giving it a

60% like I said just a very slightly

above-average movie it's perfectly

passable and it's enjoyable it's

really fun if you like adventure movies

which I do and if you like the game

that if you like the reboot games you'll

100% like this I think I really feel

like it did a great job of being a

faithful video game adaptation as well

as just being a pretty decent standalone

movie that even people that aren't

familiar with the games will probably

like to some extent and yeah I mean

that's about it so yeah

Moist Meter: Wrinkle in Time

initiating moisture protocol hello there

tonight's moisture content analysis will

be conducted on the a wrinkle in time

movie it's a smelly one yeah this is a

real fucking stinker the movie is

abominable it's a really bad movie and I

do mean that so the movie revolves

around a girl named egg whose father

goes missing he's a scientist he's super

smart Meg herself is super smart and she

goes on a journey through space and time

to save her father accompanied by her

brother Charles Wallace that's a name

you need to get used to hearing if you

plan on seeing this movie because they

never stopped fucking saying that name

throughout the entirety of the movie her

father has been captured by the it which

is a darkness that is turning people on

earth into meanies and there's only one

way to stop it through love now I

mentioned Charles Wallace being an

integral name in this movie and it truly

is anytime that character is talked to

talked about reference to past if the

character farts if you hear a fart you

know a character's gonna say Charles

Wallace

it's un-fuckin'-believable how many

times I said that name every single time

they always say Charles Wallace I heard

that name so many fucking times I heard

Charles Wallace so many fucking times

that made me want to shit holy shit you

know if they're talking to him they

don't just say you you know if they're

directly talking to him they make sure

to say it's full name an example

sentence how do you feel about that

Charles Wallace why do you think that

Charles Wallace

but Charles Wallace why do you Charles

Wallace have that opinion it's

infuriating absolutely infuriating it

becomes like nails on a chalkboard

it just gets downright painful after

hearing it for a million time in this

movie it's like you it feels like you're

getting slapped in the face while

getting mauled by a lion while getting

bit by a shark when that name's tossed

around it's just just too much if you

looked at the script for this movie the

overwhelming majority of every word on

that script would say Charles Wallace

holy shit and I'm not exaggerating

either they never say anything other

than his full name like it's he's just

committed a crime around the house with

his chores and the parents are upset

Charles Wallace good over here there's

incident it's always in any type of

situation casual or serious they say his

full name it's never just my brother you

know or my son they'll say my brother

Charles Wallace or my son Charles

Wallace they came so close at the end to

only saying my son when talking about

the kid but instead the line became it's

good to see you my son Charles Wallace

just feels so unnatural and robotic and

it's frustrating downright frustrating

to keep hearing it holy shit

and then there's another really

frustrating character to keep being beat

over the face with and it's a girl that

talks in nothing but quotes or excerpts

from famous people and it's usually

unrelated and it doesn't really have too

much significance she's a very useless

character in this movie but to keep

hearing this dumb cryptic shit the foot

farts when the man shits you know who

gives a shit it's stupid it's just dumb

it doesn't progress the plot it's just a

silly gimmick and it makes no sense and

the plot itself is awful I don't mean to

spoil this whole movie for you but if

you've read the book or seen the awful

film adaptation from before this one you

you know how it goes the end of the

movie is the most embarrassing thing to

sit there probably my least favorite

ending to a movie I've ever seen in my

life it ends with Meg confronting the it

which has taken over Charles Wallace and

she beats it by saying I love you 50

fucking times and then finally the

haymaker the knockout blow as she says I

love myself too and then bang you know

all of a sudden the darkness is gone and

everyone on earth is shaking each

other's hands and jerk and each other

off because she saved the fucking world

it's so dumb the whole movie is just

really dumb I get it's for kids

yes I'm not stupid I understand but I

don't even see how a kid would like this

movie there's really nothing in here

there's no real action there's no real

good story it's an absolute mess of a

plot the visuals are also extremely

lacking you would think a movie like

this would have fantastic visuals but it

doesn't it's very dull it's very generic

it's just not good even in the visuals

department they're passable yeah I'm not

saying they're horrible but man they're

just not very inspired or creative it's

just underwhelming very very under

oh I'm like goodness and the

performances from the adult actors were

just very lazy you could tell they

didn't really care to be there they

didn't try very hard the kid actors

really put their best foot forward and

yeah they did a good job acting and shit

I guess but it doesn't help the movie

because the movies just a jumbled mess

of shit like an absolute festering pile

of fecal matter it's just not good now I

do I will say the score in this movie is

pretty good they have nice soundtrack I

don't want to say soundtrack because I

shoehorn in some awful pop songs for no

reason in here but when they're not

doing that they have a really nice

sounding movie but it's just not good it

really isn't no matter how you look at

this movie how people are saying it's

good is beyond me we have to have

watched different movies because sitting

through that was so embarrassing and

that's not something I toss around

lightly it was just so it's so silly and

cliche I couldn't feel anything but

embarrassment for being there watching

and having paid to see it it's so bad

it's just really dumb let's plug this

shit into the moist meter I'm giving it

a 20% I know if everything I said that

seems high but I do want to stress the

movie is competent

it is a competently made movie albeit an

over-reliance on close up shots and

stand stills of people staring it's it

really relies on that heavily which has

no place in a sci-fi movie where it's

supposed to be about this beautiful

scenery and shit but it's still a

competently shot and made movie there's

a beginning middle and end at none of

them being very good but it's all there

and done at least to a passable extent

and like I said the score is pretty

decent and the visuals are fine it's

just you would expect more from

something like this it's just it's it's

really not worth seeing even as a fan of

the book or any if you're a fan of

anything with quality this isn't

something you'll enjoy it's not so bad

it's good it's so bad it's you want to

get the fuck out of there that's it so

yeah

Moist Meter: Annihilation

you see any moisture protocol hello

there I just woke up welcome to the

early morning moisture meter brought to

you by early or the early mornings today

I'd like to talk about a movie I saw

last night as is tradition on the moist

meter

it's called annihilation it's a

brand-new movie I went into this movie

knowing absolutely nothing about it I

hadn't even seen a single trailer I just

knew it was going to be a pretty popular

movie and I couldn't be more incredibly

surprised by how good it turned out I

didn't know it was by the same guy who

directed ex machina which I fucking love

I didn't know it was based on books he

could have told me it was based on

fucking serial I wouldn't have cared and

I think that knowing absolutely nothing

about this really helped me enjoy the

movie overall because I know a lot of

people were disappointed by how far it

deviated from the book but since I

didn't read the book I didn't have that

letdown I might actually read the book

now because this movie was so fucking

good and I haven't read a book

cover-to-cover since the outsiders in

sixth grade but who knows maybe this is

the movie that gets me into reading and

jerking off to adult novels now but

anyway this movie's a thought-provoking

one and it's not just an artsy smell

your own fart kind of movie that just

challenged you to think and doesn't

really have any substance besides just

making you think kind of like mother

where all you do is be bored throughout

most of the movie until the end and then

you're left confused and thinking about

it this movie has a lot of substance to

it so even if you want to ignore all the

thought-provoking elements of it you'll

still enjoy the movie

whereas in mother I just thought it was

extremely boring and you're just

inundated with close-up shots of

Jennifer Lawrence's face like you're

fucking looking at it through a pirate

spyglass this movie has a whole lot more

to offer than just thought-provoking

stuff if you choose to ignore it and

don't want to really think about it

the movie visually is probably one of

the best I've ever seen it's so

incredibly appealing it's such a surreal

looking movie I don't want to spoil

anything about it

because I I think knowing nothing about

it is a huge benefit when seeing this

but the visuals they are able to capture

here are nothing shy of awe-inspiring it

sci-fi movie it's based around the

premise where Natalie Portman's husband

goes into a mysterious place called the

shimmer where a lot of crazy shit's

going down and that's all I really want

to give away about it inside the shimmer

it's just ranging from beautiful to

Lovecraftian horror it's just so great

and it's just I really can't gush about

the visuals enough you you really have

to see them to believe them another

thing that I was blown away by is the

score this movie has one of the best

scores I think I've ever heard Blade

Runner being my favorite movie score

ever this one's close up in that area

it's so good especially at the end the

ending to port well towards the end it's

not like the actual ending but right

towards the end they play something

called the alien that was just

jaw-dropping and the ending track will

not the very end but a track towards the

end of the movie at probably the biggest

part of the end of the movie had a track

called the alien and that paired with

the visuals led to an experience where

it made me question why even on fucking

earth anymore it made me think maybe the

cashier had replaced my popcorn with

truths that looked like popcorn it was

so loud and it fits so well and it was

so unique sounding it was just an

unbelievable ending and I'm not talking

about the very end in fact I think the

very end of the movie was actually a bit

weak not that it was bad or anything it

was just really a generic kind of ending

that you expect from pretty much every

sci-fi movie I really didn't expect

anihilation to end on a note like that

it's not bad or anything and I mean

there was nothing wrong with the ending

it just felt weak in comparison to

everything that came before it it didn't

really wrap it up as well as I think it

should have but it was still just

totally fine now the movie will

challenge you to think you know is the

bad thing even bad what makes it bad you

know is just existing bad because that's

fundamentally what the bad thing boils

down to it just wants to exist but at

the cost of humans then it also always

ties everything back to the idea of

annihilation how humans will constantly

seek out self-destruction and that theme

is woven throughout pretty much every

part of this movie

I really respect and it really fits well

into everything in this movie I think

the the parts that challenge you to

think were really well done it's

ambiguous enough where you can ignore

shit like that and still have a great

movie left behind it's just a really fun

movie that a lot of people will walk

away with a different interpretation of

if they choose to even think about it

that hard and you don't have to you can

still enjoy this is just a sci-fi movie

without thinking hard at all now let's

get to the cold water here let's dump

some of this hot semen on you what I

didn't like a lot of the dialogue was

straight up ass just total dirty anus I

don't know how the dialogue was so bad

at parts not that it's the worst

dialogue I've ever heard it's not you

know the room level or anything but it

was just not good dialogue a lot and a

lot of parts of this movie which is a

shame and a couple of the characters

were just totally not good at all if

you're watching this characters from

annihilation that I didn't like I didn't

like you and I hope you know that I'm

not blaming you but I didn't like you

there's also something a lot of people

are bringing me up it involves sex

scenes that were some for some reason

spliced at random points in this movie I

know why they're there and I'll get to

that in just a second I'm not gonna

spoil it or anything but throughout a

lot of this movie when things are going

really well and this shimmer not well

plot wise but well for the audience

where it's fucking cool to watch all

this shit going on and the shimmer

everything just all over the place and

super fucking cool it'll hard cut to

some sex scenes a couple times

throughout the movie that just seemingly

come out of nowhere and really do play

no role in the movie on the surface

they're really there for symbolism but

even still it's just jarring to have

this hard cut that makes it feel like

annihilation was filmed on an old porn

VHS and they accidentally left a few of

the scenes in it's it's silly it really

is and I can totally understand why

people don't like that I didn't like it

either but I do get why it's there cuz

it all ties back to the title of the

film and it does make sense from that

perspective but that's that's reaching

its it's really not worth it to keep

them in there they could have replaced

that with something that's a little less

fucking

and you know in all honesty so I totally

get that and I will put that as a

negative thing here because it is it

really it really fucks up a bit of the

pacing when they're in the shimmer

because out of nowhere oh this is super

cool oh and there's their she's riding a

cock again yeah I mean come on you can

do something better than that to still

get the symbolism across but anyway

those are really my only big complaints

about the movie I think this movie is a

must-see for people who like sci-fi

movies or movies that will challenge you

to think I'm giving this movie a 90

percent on the moist meter I would have

given it a 95 percent if not for those

complaints I mentioned they do take away

from the movie quite a bit but it is a

fucking fantastic movie an absolutely

remarkable movie one I didn't expect at

all and I'm super pleased with how it

turned out really really good I would

HIGHLY encourage pretty much anyone out

there to watch this movie it's more than

just a sci-fi movie and a

thought-provoking movie there's some

action here with guns pumping out lead

bullets flying nutsacks explode and

there's quite a bit of gore in this

movie people's fucking necks and mouths

getting ripped out by incredible looking

creatures let's the fucking bear that

looks like it been genetically altered

by Frankenstein there's some beautiful

environments that I've never seen in any

other movie like this beautiful creature

design as well you know one second you

have this horrifying looking crocodile

alligator thing shark and the next

minute you find some Pokemon in the

forest it's just great I really can't

recommend this movie enough it's a

fucking great movie that's it so yeah

Moist Meter: Black Panther

initiating moisture protocol hi there

and welcome to the newest entry into the

moist expanded universe today we're

looking at the new black panther movie

I'm gonna go ahead and start with my

biggest complaint about this and it has

nothing to do with the movie the fucking

troglodyte cro-magnon homunculus

cave-dwelling lunatic that sat next to

me made this the most unpleasant

experience I've ever had in a movie

theater

she was so unbelievably loud at every

single point in this movie for the first

hour and a half I swear to God this

might have been her first time seeing a

movie she had only been explained the

concept of movies but hadn't seen it in

practice and she dove into this one and

of course sat right next to me every

single thing that happened on screen she

was making a loud comment and I don't

mean just like a loud whisper like a

normal talking voice I'm talking

literally shouting like a fucking soccer

commentator every time they score a goal

if a character breathed on screen you

were gonna get an earful of what she

thought about that nice deep breath or a

speech if there was action god forbid

there was action she was louder than any

sound effect it was so bad to the point

where three seats down there was these

two dudes that kept looking at me cuz I

was sitting right next to her giving me

one of these bro nods you know one of

these and then some of these just enough

to tell me hey get her to stop as if I'm

gonna lean over and stick a binky in

this bitch's mouth she just would not

stop being so disruptive to everyone in

the theater and of course she had her

phone out cuz all children do but

luckily just like all children with a

sugar rush she crashed about an hour and

a half in she fell asleep and that was

my favorite part of the movie when she

slept definitely the best arc of the

movie but now let's get to the actual

movie it's fucking fantastic I think

this is probably Marvel's most visually

breathtaking movie the setting the

costume the special effects

all of it top-notch and I genuinely do

believe it's probably Marvel's best also

marvel at the top of their game in terms

of music here the music in this the

score really really surprisingly good

extremely good even it was a very very

enjoyable eye candy movie with a lot of

audio stimulus that's sure to get even

the most stubborn of audio snobs Iraq

it was really good in both departments

but there were a few shortcomings here

the biggest one being comedy most Marvel

movies these days have a lot of comedy

in them this one doesn't that's not a

complaint I actually liked that it went

for a more serious approach but it did

try and sprinkle some half-assed attempt

at comedy in here and it didn't land

nobody in the theater laughed at any of

them and in fact they even shoehorned in

a tired old dank meme with a what are

those I wanted to leave right there I'm

not gonna lie in fact even a few people

in the audience groaned when they

shoehorned in a what are those as a

front row center stage joke in the movie

it was pathetic but I really do like

that this was a more serious Marvel

movie I just wish they really just

didn't even bother with such bad jokes I

also think this movie has one of

Marvel's best villains Michael B Jordan

with kill monger is a fantastic villain

a lot of viewers can really relate to

him he's all a very sympathetic which is

surprising because he has no problems

just slaughtering a bunch of people but

still his cause is one that you can kind

of rally behind even if you don't agree

with his methods you can still kind of

support what he's going for his ideals

this story here is also pretty good I do

feel like it's not as impactful on the

universe as the other entries in the

Marvel Cinematic Universe until the end

where Wakanda gets involved directly

with the universe that's about the

biggest thing here and it is a very big

deal but in terms of you know the bad

thing that's going on in the movie here

it kind of just boils down to well we

have some good weapons we're gonna go

ahead and give these weapons away it's

you know it's not really one of those

things they're like shit that's super

fucking evil oh my god that has to we

got to put the kibosh on that right away

but it's still a good story just to me

it's not one that really carries a lot

of weight until the end with the Wakanda

entering the world basically another big

complaint I have is this Falls the

action falls in to the same standard

shit is a lot of standard action movie

is it's taken levels of jump cuts during

action you can't tell who's getting hit

or what's hitting them for all you know

they're fighting a fucking phantom you

can't really make out the action and a

lot of points in here which is a shame

because Marvel has been doing a pretty

job recently of not making it just look

like two action figures colliding in a

washing machine like most action movies

do these days but I really just don't

have a whole lot of complaints about

this movie so let's pop this shit into

the moist meter I'm giving this an 85

percent just another really strong

Marvel movie here I just don't have a

whole lot to say about it without giving

away any spoilers so overall just

another good Marvel movie that's it so

yeah

Moist Meter: Fifty Shades Freed

you see anything moisture protocol moist

meter 50 shades of gray two things

synonymous with sodden panties Fifty

Shades just had a new movie come out

Fifty Shades freed I just saw it it was

exactly as you'd expect to date the only

bad movie that I haven't been able to

finish to completion because it's so bad

is Fifty Shades of Grey

that movie was insufferably bad I didn't

see the second one but I really wanted

to muscle through it and see this one I

felt like I had to at least finish one

Fifty Shades movie and I did I saw this

in theaters which brings me to the first

topic I'd like to discuss why does

anyone want to see these movies in

theaters it's a very uncomfortable

experience I'm sitting shoulder to

shoulder with a 40 plus year old man and

his wife watching softcore porn on a big

screen very reminiscent of the days in

middle school or we'd all gather our

friends together and throw in an r-rated

movie that has a scene with titties in

it you just looking around like oh wow

well we're all watching tits together

it's just unpleasant it's just very

uncomfortable and make no mistake the

whole audience was 40 plus year olds a

hundred percent of them except for me

and my girlfriend when we went to see it

it's like I just walked into the

geriatrics where just stumbled in the

bingo night here this is just genuinely

softcore porn for soccer moms whose

vaginas have just been dusty for ten

plus years now it's I get that but I

mean this it's such a bad movie it's

shitty softcore porn with a shittier

storyline than real porn I'll break it

down for you so this movie's storyline

consists of Anastasia Steele marrying

Christian Grey all they do is just kind

of hang out and occasionally have very

uninteresting sex there's also a subplot

where a bad guy stalker kidnaps

Christian Grey sister and they have this

little weird out of place action thing

going on they said I can't really call

it action cuz there is no action it's

just dialogue but the dialogue revolves

around this guy being a bad guy and he

does kidnap his sister they also have

this subplot that they hint at never

touch on again where Elliott's cheating

on Kate and they even show Elliot with

another girl and then he marries Kate

and they never bring up that point with

the other girl it's a very disjointed

bad movie from a storyline perspective

and the lines in here are some of the

worst lines I've ever heard in movies to

date the first 50 shades of grey has my

least favorite line in cinema history

which is I don't make love I fuck I

wanted to puke right there I wanted to

go fuck myself it was just so

uncomfortable to hear that come out of a

character's mouth I just wanted to leave

and I did I didn't finish the movie like

I said here the lines are just as bad

the same caliber of writing it's

horrible it's worse than Harry Potter

fanfic it's worse than My Little Pony

fanfic it's so unbelievably bad and

unnatural and just disgusting to hear

it's insulting really

in fact even making a moist meter on

this movie is an insult to moist meter

this series but I felt obligated to do

so since I did force myself to go see

this because I muscled my way through it

because I felt like I had to because it

was a fucking mission of mine really

that was my new year's resolution to

finish a Fifty Shades movie and I'm

proud to say I've done it I did I am now

fifty Shades freed from the bad fucking

trilogy here but I don't really know

what else to say there's just nothing

redeeming about this if you're going

there for the sex there's not a whole

lot of it and it's not good I don't at

all no one under the age of 40 will get

anything from this movie if you've been

on the internet you can find real porn

you can find actual porn you don't have

to go sit through this insufferably bad

storyline bad dialogue horrible music

everything set to the tune of this weird

awful pop music you don't have to suffer

through that you can just watch the

action from the comfort of your own home

you don't even have to be shoulder to

shoulder with a stranger that just

starts dripping sweat during all the

action scenes with sex and knowing for a

fact that he's sprouting a big stiffy

it's you know you can just be in your

own privacy watching porn it's it's a

lot more enjoyable than watching this

pile of shit so let's just plug this

into the moist meter like I said there's

nothing redeeming about this so I'm

giving this a 10 percent there

nothing here absolutely nothing of value

in this movie I will say I guess the

acting to some extent is is good you

guess as good as softcore porn acting

can get it's just bad

all around in all possible areas as a

surprise to no one it's I don't think

anyone out there is just recoiled in

their chair like holy shit only a 10%

for Fifty Shades free

I think it's expected it's a bad movie

it's a bad trilogy but it's finally

fucking done then which is great so yeah

that's it see ya

Moist Meter: Maze Runner The Death Cure

initiating moisture splish-splash I'm

sucking your ass I'm just kidding That's

not me that's the new Maze Runner movie

called Maze Runner the death cure

welcome to the moist meter let's go

ahead and analyze the moisture content

in the third installment of the

underwhelming franchise called Maze

Runner so let's dive right in the

biggest thing I didn't like about this

movie is nothing makes sense in the

jumbled mess of a plot that is almost

insulting to the viewers intelligence

this is a movie where you can't ask why

you can't ask why things happen why is a

character doing this why is that

happening what was that decision for why

is this going on well the answer is

because suck a fart out of my asshole it

happens because I wrote it my three year

old loved it just because is why that is

your answer to everything if you had any

questions from the previous movies

they're not going to be answered here

and the decision-making makes no sense

in this movie why things happen the way

they do make absolutely no sense at all

and it's incredibly frustrating really I

loved the premise of Maze Runner I

really do think it's a cool premise it's

except when it turns into some type of

gothic zombie flick but when it's not

doing that I think there's a lot of cool

things it offers this movie visually is

pretty damn good but I can't excuse how

nonsensical the plot is the characters

motives make no sense why things happen

the way they do make absolutely no sense

it's just it's silly downright silly and

it suffers from one of my biggest tropes

that I hate in movies my least favorite

movie trope and it's when a character is

in a life-or-death situation they have

this opportunity to get to safety

but instead of immediately getting to

safety they watch something happening

that is threatening their lives for

example I'm not doing a good job

explaining it so let's say Harold is our

protagonist he's an 86 year old man and

he finds himself in a building that's

being flooded with radiation as there's

flying sharks coming around his life is

very much threatened but right outside

of the window is a helicopter with a

rope ladder

Harold is only a few steps away from

that rope ladder but as he's going

towards the rope ladder he hears a

explosion all of a sudden there's a kind

you ravaging behind him now his

attention is just fixated on the kaiju

now he stopped trying to get to safety

and he's watching the kaiju and he's

just he's gonna fucking kill himself

because he's too busy watching this

unfold instead of getting to safety this

movie has that a ton of times there's so

many times in this movie where the

characters sit around in there in mortal

danger and just watch the mortal danger

and so to get to safety that is right

they're readily available for him I hate

that trope it's the laziest storytelling

the laziest writing ever it's so silly

and it makes me so incredibly distraught

and irate so that's a big complaint of

mine never do that intro

never ever ever do shit like that if

you're an aspiring director out there

please please never do that I mean it I

mean if you do that I'm gonna find you

and I'm gonna bite your fucking foreskin

off or something just something fierce

because it makes me that angry but now

let's get to some things I did like the

fucking director here did wonders with

his low relatively speaking low budget

he made this movie visually stunning I

think he did a great job he built a nice

universe and it looked great he also

knew how to handle important character

deaths here he made them very emotional

scenes and it was reflected in good

acting from the actors and also just a

really cool send-off for the characters

I'm not trying to spoil anything but you

know characters are gonna die it's the

end of the trilogy here you can expect

something like that and he handles it

really well wear something like Hunger

Games just throws away the most

important characters up what happened to

Brynn yeah you know I think a tank ran

her over or something on it's a fucking

shame let's keep moving on you know hear

it clearly affects the characters and

its really well handled and I'd really

like that

but overall I don't think this is a good

movie I wouldn't call it a good movie I

wouldn't necessarily call it a bad movie

either it's an enjoyable movie if you

can just excuse how nonsensical and

jumbled everything is but you know that

doesn't really make it worth seeing in

my opinion there's a lot better movies

out there that do what this movie did

better but if you like The Maze Runner

movies I do think this movie's worth

finishing watching to finish the story

because it gives you closure

it's not the greatest closure it's not

really well executed or that satisfying

but it's good enough better than The

Hunger Games that's for fucking sure I'm

gonna go ahead and go on record and say

I think what killed the Hunger Games is

my character in the movie

not even being in the fucking movie that

pissed me the fuck off if you're

watching Hunger Games directors Jennifer

Lawrence if my character is in that

movie you'd be looking at 98% on Rotten

Tomatoes at least at least maybe even

some Academy Awards across the board -

who knows just saying that's good

could've been that could've have that if

you just kept my goddamn stupid fucking

line in that movie but anyway enough of

that moving on let's pop this shit in

the moist meter I'm giving this a 45

percent I would consider it an almost

average movie there's just so much wrong

with it so many lazy choices but I think

working with the source material I

haven't read the books but I've read

enough about them to know that the third

book was just a mess that nobody liked

almost unanimously hated and I think

working with that as your source

material they did a good job here and

the universe is nice the world is great

so that's always a plus it's it's an

enjoyable movie but I wouldn't consider

it a good one I'd consider it just

barely below average that's the 45%

worth seeing if you've seen the previous

two maze runners don't go in there with

high hopes and you might have a good

time that's it so yeah

Moist Meter: Paddington 2

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today I'll be analyzing the

wetness of Paddington too and I'm not

just referring to the wetness of the

tears I nearly shed at the end of this

movie I'm talking about the moisture

content of the entire product this

movies been getting a hundred percent

and tonight of tens across the board and

I was honestly a bit hesitant to see it

I get very emotional when I'm faced with

overly cute things and Paddington is an

overly incredibly adorable cute stuffy

Wafi little teddy bear and I was afraid

to see it I was more afraid to see

Paddington too than any horror movie

ever made because it's a weird feeling

getting all emotional and public like

that but I still went to see it and you

all know me is someone who conveys a

wide range of emotions really where my

heart on my sleeve so you can only

imagine how emotional I was seeing this

cute this cute bear in action and man

I'm super glad I went to see that movie

that is probably one of the most

surprisingly amazing movies I've ever

seen it absolutely deserves all of the

incredible rave reviews exceeding the

biggest sin is how poorly this movie is

doing at the box office if Jesus came

back to us today he would see a lot of

 up no doubt about that but I

think the straw that would big break the

camel's back and have Jesus right all of

us office of terrible species is seeing

how bad Paddington too is doing in the

box office it's genuinely just

disheartening this is a genuinely

fantastic movie that deserves all of the

success in the world it is perfect from

start to finish I couldn't stop smiling

and it's not just for kids although it's

predominantly a kids movie obviously

let's go ahead and call a rip dildo rip

dildo it is a kid's movie but it is so

wholesome and so fun to watch the

cinematography is superb there's some

scenes in here with really good

animation in terms of like different

mediums and how its portrayed all of it

it's just so good the comedy wasn't too

childish

some of them would get like a genuine

little giggle out of me

giggle but like a little you know one of

those blown the air out of your nose and

stuff like that and it's hard to make me

laugh at a movie so getting that is a

Herculean task so a good job Paddington

the movie is just so fun and so

wholesome I have no complaints about

this movie absolutely none

the cast was great everything was acted

beautifully story was super fun really

fast paced a lot going on a fun little

adventure it's just oh my goodness I

can't rave enough about Paddington - I

never thought I would be this blown away

by a movie like Paddington - it's just

amazing what they were able to

accomplish and how well they did it

Paddington is the cutest little thing

the absolute cutest little thing and at

the end of the movie you know exactly

how it's gonna unfold but you can't help

but just get super emotional I didn't

cry um I'm happy to say I managed to

muscle my way through that without

flexing the tear ducts so that's you

know I'm still a big strong man with

hairy testicles but man I was close I

was talking close I've only cried at two

movies well one movie and one TV show

the only movie I ever cried at was radio

with Cuba Gooding jr. only TV show is

Pokemon when Ash was shooing away

Pikachu but this movie that came close

to being number three what a great

 movie I highly recommend this to

anyone out there and this is a great

movie if you have a niece nephew son

daughter and you know they want to go

see a movie but all these movies have

you know rock and roll titties and well

there's no blood because blood wouldn't

get him a pg-13 rating any more BR but

you know rock and roll in titties all

over the place so you want to take them

to something where you feel safe and you

know they learn something and have a

good time and you don't want to be bored

out of your mind either Paddington -

absolutely Paddington - hands down it's

just a great movie for everyone

not just for kids I love the movie

absolutely love it I cannot compliment

the movie enough so let's just go ahead

and pop this into the Moi's meter

I'm giving this a 90% and the only

reason I'm not giving it a hundred

percent is just because like I've said

before a hundred percent I feel is

reserved for absolute masterpieces that

I think everyone needs to get up and go

see immediately I'm talking a movie

where I don't care if you can't even a

to buy yourself a bag of Doritos you

better start getting your ass to wishing

wells and plundering that

collecting quarters to save up enough to

buy a ticket to a movie I give a hundred

percent to on a moist meter that's the

kind of filmers film and video game I'm

reserving for a hundred percent and

Paddington too is not that kind of movie

it's a fantastic movie it's an

amazing movie even but it's not a movie

where I think everyone needs to go see

it right away it's not a movie that made

my nipples grow three inches it didn't

make me taller if it made me taller I'd

give that well above 100 percent on the

moist meter but it's a great

movie that I do think is absolutely

worth saying if you want to see a movie

or if you have to take you know a

younger person to a movie and you don't

want one that's gonna bore the out

of you and I'm then given a 95% either

only because it is still a kids movie it

if you're an adult it's not going to

make this huge lasting impression on you

that's going to change your outlook on

life I feel I need to clarify a bit

better why I didn't give this movie a 95

percent and it's not just because all

it's a kid's movie it's not mature

enough for me it didn't change the way I

perceive reality and it didn't open my

third eye it's because I reserved 95 and

a hundred two movies that really push

boundaries movies that really excel in

every possible area they take risks and

it pays off and it becomes this

masterpiece 95 s and a hundreds are

pretty interchangeable to me and there's

really no difference between a 95 and a

hundred to me the gap is ninety to a

hundred and paddington two is the

closest thing to me wanting to give it a

95 but I don't really think that's

accurate because to me that says this is

a movie that everyone everywhere will

love no matter what their personal

tastes are and paty cantú is not that

kind of movie it's an incredible movie

that I do think the majority of people

will enjoy as long as they're open to

just having a mindlessly wholesome fun

adventure ride a very cute movie but

it's not a movie where I feel is one

that took a lot of risks or didn't play

by the rules it's just a movie that

excelled in all of the areas that it hit

and those areas it hit

our areas that are covered in a million

other kids movies and movies like

Paddington - I just think Paddington -

is the best one so that's my

justification for not going above a 90

but it is an absolutely fantastic movie

I have no complaints about it everything

it wanted to do did beautifully a

 great movie I couldn't be

happier with my purchase of those

Paddington 2 tickets I want to

frame those bad boys

I want those bitches up on the wall I

want to get Paddington to memorabilia

god damn that movie was good so

yeah that's it so yeah

Moist Meter: The Commuter

initiating moisture moist meters trains

to words that have nothing to do with

one another and yet those two words will

collide on this analysis of the new

movie the commuters starring Liam Neeson

train enthusiasts have been having a

fucking field day with all these

Hollywood blockbusters about trains

coming out and buy a field day I mean

there's been two movies about trains

which I guess is infinitely more than

the last decade or so first there was

the Murder on the Orient Express I mean

I didn't make a moist meter on it I know

many of you probably had sleepless

nights wondering my opinion of the movie

so I'll give it away now I thought it

was a good movie and now there's this

one the commuter and I thought I was

gonna be far shittier than it turned out

to be in fact even came up with a really

clever play on words

the commuter more like Murder on the

Orient Express cuz the movies boring but

it wasn't boring so that's no longer

applicable that's not to say it was a

really good movie it was it was an

above-average movie slightly and they

tried to be more than just an action

movie which I can respect but it didn't

do it super well everything was very

predictable it was very formulaic I

don't think it really challenged anyone

to think and you know had anyone on the

edge of the seat ohh-hoo-hoo sprin who

who is the witness because he could

pretty much figure it out the second

they introduced the character but that's

not to say it was a bad movie because it

didn't rely on suspense all that much in

my opinion it it had a lot of fun action

decent dialogue the writing wasn't bad

some of the characters were dumb just

fucking dumb but others were good so

Liam Neeson plays Liam Neeson on a train

and Liam Neeson on a train gets an offer

to look for somebody and bug their bag

and you can kind of understand that it

implies they're gonna kill the person

whose bag gets bugged but he gets

$100,000 if he does it so then he starts

doing it and shit unfolds and it's well

it's an it's morally wrong and Liam

Neeson has always been the epitome of

justice and truth and victory and

directions so Liam Neeson doesn't go

through with it and he turns the tables

on the bad guys I don't mean to spoil

anything I

I know really getting off script here by

me unleashing all the the plot secrets

but anyway it's not a bad movie it's

very predictable everything's very

formulaic but it's still fun to watch it

tried to be more than just an action

movie it didn't really excel in suspense

or making the audience question who is

the person Liam Neeson is looking for

who is Prynne I think most people were

able to figure out who Prynne was the

second the character was introduced I'd

also like to make a little side note on

my little camera here it actually has a

box around his head because it

recognizes him as a person in this video

so now it's kind of fucking creeping me

out because I just popped up now I feel

like he's haunted like an actual ghost

is there in this video right here but

anyway it was fun it was a fun movie

there was nothing super great about it

but it wasn't that this is just another

movie where I don't have a whole lot to

say because it's like every other action

movie that tries to be a little bit more

it doesn't excel in a little bit more

that it tries to fiddle its dick into

but it does well as being just an

entertaining thrill ride it has a good

cast

it has good writing and good acting for

the most part some characters fucking

some some are decent I have to point out

the biggest fucking plot hole at all

action movies like this half the bad

guys kill themselves for the most part

so Liam Neeson gets hired by the bad

guys to find someone they don't know on

this train well logically why wouldn't

you just crash the Train take everyone

out and you guarantee that you have

killed this person instead of relying on

this wild card you know nothing about

who was an ex-cop that's just it's a

recipe for disaster

and in the movie they show that they

even had measures to just derail the

train and kill everybody but now you've

already included this ex-cop in here

who's going to obviously try and stop

that it's just silly why would you even

bother it's fucking dumb and they give a

little bit of justification for why they

would just immediately derail the train

but it's silly and it doesn't make a

whole lot of sense like every other Liam

Neeson action movie though

there was any type of hand-to-hand

combat or pretty much anything if he's

jumping over a fence if he's even moving

you're getting about 15 cuts and it's

gonna be jarring you're not gonna know

what's going on or why I also really

kind of liked in this movie how Liam

Neeson wasn't really all that good at

investigating it started off like he

kind of knew what he was doing and he

was good at kind of getting the ball

rolling and getting some suspects and he

understood how to get everyone in the

ball game and in his mental notes of who

it could be and then at the towards the

end of the movie he just says fuck that

pulls out a gun who is the person I'm

looking for which one of you is it Oh

God okay well it's not you because

everyone starts you know giving them all

the information possible it's not me

here B is this it's not me because it's

not me because this and then one person

well I guess it is me and that's just

kind of how it unfolds so pretty much

everything in the beginning was kind of

worthless only one thing you needed to

do which was get everyone in a closed

space which he does at the end and then

pull out a gun it's an effective means

of getting information you need and

finding the person you're looking for

but kind of makes it not all that

exciting and all the clues not really

meaning too fucking much it's very clear

this movie was a Liam Neeson movie from

the get-go before they even had a script

before they even had a cast they had a

room full of dudes come together and say

let's make a movie about a train well

what's special about this train well

Liam Neeson's on that trend and then

they went down the Liam Neeson checklist

on everything that needs to be in a Liam

Neeson movie and they threw that shit

into a big fucking pot and then they you

know boiled that bitch and now we have

the commuter in all its glory and by

Allah calor I mean and it's very very

minimally above average glory but it's I

don't know I just find that to be fun to

watch because you expect it from Liam

Neeson and it's entertaining he delivers

Liam Neeson the commuter should really

just be called the Liam Neeson and he's

moving on a vehicle and that vehicle

happens to be a train it's just you know

I don't have a whole lot to fucking say

about this movie but I saw it people

were asking me if I'd see it make a

moist meter on it so I am let's just pop

this shit into the moist meter I'm

giving it a 55% it's not stellar it's

worth it if you like action

and I guess if you like to play a little

bit of a game of who the bad guy or who

the witness he's looking for it is even

though I'm sure most of you'll know

right away they make it blatantly

obvious it's it's fun to watch if you

like just mindless action movies it

doesn't try to be a mindless action

movie because it tries to make you guess

who's he who he needs to find but it

doesn't do a good job of it but it's

still fun it's still a fun fucking movie

especially for a January shit show it's

not that big of a shit show it's just

decent you know you can kick back you

could put one hand on your cock the

other hand on a Bible and just watch

some Liam Neeson on a train as the clock

winds down and he has to find someone

for you know some reason and then it has

a happy ending like all Liam Neeson

movies does but it's fun probably worth

seeing

so yeah

Moist Meter: Insidious The Last Key

initiating moisture hello a util tootle

and welcome to the moist meter one of

the biggest complaints i've seen in the

comments over the course of the moist

meters history so far is the lack of

background the white walls making it

seem like some type of fucking insane

asylum really lack of professionalism so

I got this jumbo Asian man sticker as a

gag gift for Christmas and I thought

that looks like a pretty professional

background so I was listening to you all

in the comments and now I'm saying you

can hold my penis

there's your background right there so

today on the moist meeting chopping

block is the new insidious movie

insidious the last key or insidious four

or as I like to call it in shittiest

bore it is a boring horror movie if you

have watched horror movies over the

course of the last decade or so we're

gonna go through the checklist of what

makes them all bad and insidious has all

of those shortcomings horrible plot that

makes no sense check bad characters

check by writing check bad dialogue

check characters that make the stupidest

fucking decisions in every possible

situation check now here's where

insidious really starts to excel in

these horrible areas soundtrack sound

effects in the insidious movie any time

anything at all happens it sounds like a

fucking sack of potatoes gets dropped on

a grand piano keyboard it's obnoxious

it's silly its comical more than

anything I just spit everywhere because

I'm fucking disgusted by this movie it's

just not good and it's insulting to the

viewer hearing these horrible sound

effects as an attempt to scare or

startle you it's dumb let's go back to

the checklist over reliance on jump

scares check entire reliance on jump

stairs for scariness check and now let's

branch out for the checklist again this

has some type of dumb stupid fucking

sci-fi subplot it's not really a subplot

that's the whole fucking movie towards

the end where they go into the further

which is kind of like lucid dreaming

except you know the further your your

astral projecting yourself onto assholes

and they have superpowers here and it's

so fucking silly to watch it's just

silly downright fucking dumb to listen

to it's dumb to watch it's stupid I've

seen all the insidious movies up til

here I never thought that

series was particularly strong and this

movie is the worst one it's by far the

worst one and I know a lot of people are

gonna find me all but insidious is

fucking great it's a it's groundbreaking

they really connected shit with horror

and made a horror shit show which I will

agree with but what I'm trying to say is

this is just bad even for insidious

everything about it was bad except for a

couple things which I'll mention real

quick there's a few scenes that I

thought did a decent job of building

tension before they completely ruined it

with a horrible attempt that a jump

scare or a bad joke and I think their

villain in concept was cold but not in

practice up until the end they did a

decent job of teasing the villain and

making him seem very cool and mysterious

but then at the end they lift the

curtain up they blow their whole load

it's like watching your porn video and

it closes out suddenly and you see your

reflection and phone screen and the

computer screen and it takes you out of

the experience it makes you upset and

that's what the ending did to this

villain they just showed the villain and

all of his redneck inbred glory he

looked like some type of Hills Have Eyes

abomination fucking mutant thing and

they made him almost human to a degree

it just kind of became this guy's this

you know an annoying neighbor that likes

to watch people fight and he also has a

super strength and spoiler alert he gets

killed in the most boring way and

old-lady smashes a lantern on his chest

and it acts like some type of fucking

nuclear detonation like a command man

with he's gone then they also did this

really loose tie-in to the first

insidious movie which was just fucking

silly

spoiler alert again I don't mean to ruin

it for all you insidious diehards out

there but I need to talk about how dumb

it is so they open a door which opens up

into Dalton's attic where you know he

enters the further but it's really silly

because they open the door they see

Dalton there and then just walk away

leaving the door wide open but they have

like three seconds just blankly staring

at Dalton before leaving it's like they

made a conscious decision to just leave

this door open for this little kid to

explore it fucking silly they're

supposed to be the good guys here and

they just condemn this Dalton kid to you

know getting possessed and shit it's

done

everything about this movie was dumb

except for a few times where I was like

you know that's not a bad scene but

those were so few and far between I

wouldn't recommend this to even the

biggest insidious fucking soft cocked

fan so let's plug this shit into the boy

meter this is a 20% it's really bad

under no circumstances would I encourage

anyone to see this no matter how much

you like the insidious franchise it's

really bad it was a big waste of time

it was kind of fun to hear the

audience's reaction only because there

was one dude who every time there was

tension building up he just throw his

hands up no oh hell no and that was fun

he made it fun so I'm giving it a 20

because that guy made it fun it's just

not a good movie it's it's really not

fear horror fan you won't like if you're

a fan of movies you won't like it if you

enjoy anything that's even an iota of

fun you won't like it it's just not a

good movie that's it see ya

Moist Meter: Bright

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we're gonna be analyzing the

moisture content of the new Netflix

movie bright this movie is getting

double fisted by critics but the

audience is loving the movie has the

biggest discrepancy I've seen on Rotten

Tomatoes in a long time between the

critic score and the audience score the

soft micro dict critics have given it a

29 percent but the audience is giving it

a 94 percent as of making this moist

meter so what do we the Sun scientists

think about this the experts well as

with everything on the 2017 internet

landscape and opinions gonna get you

shit on no matter what but we're not

afraid of it we're not afraid to use

scientific data to say without a shadow

without the critics are full of shit on

this one is it a perfect movie fuck no

is it a great movie also fuck no is it a

good enjoyable and fun movie yes fuck

yes when I first saw the previews I was

expecting a minim black type movie since

it had Will Smith and it had a very

similar looking universe and I got a

kind of men in black type movie not

quite as good as men in black 1 & 2

we're gonna pretend men in black 3

doesn't exist because that movie was

just an absolute pile of abortion but it

was similar in style to men and black 1

& 2 which I will always love and you

know it that's comparable I can compare

this movie to men in black because

they're very similar

unlike the major critics out there that

are comparing this movie to the fucking

emoji movie that's just so lazy in such

a blatant attempt to drum up clicks for

your dying website it's so sad

at least try and make a good article and

defend your lousy points on why this

movie is one of the worst of the year

which it's not it's not a great movie

there's a lot of flaws that you're not

wrong to point out but those flaws don't

detract from the enjoyment of the film

especially since the movie doesn't take

itself all that seriously the storyline

is nonsensical points there's plot holes

there's some bad acting here and there

but all of it adds to this cheesy

mindless fun that this movie delivers

its pleasant to look at the universe was

very interesting

I enjoyed pretty much everything about

this movie including all of its flaws

there's a lot of things I can pick apart

it's a very goofy premise of a movie a

magic wand everyone's trying to get you

know well Cosmo fucking lost his magic

wand and

going for it and it's fun it's just fun

there's a lot of action too each scene

leads to a giant shootout or something

cool happening it's not just exposition

out the ass and it's not just jokes

there's jokes sprinkled throughout the

action and they use the action for jokes

I love that kind of shit it's not Jackie

Chan levels of action comedy but it's

good it's fun it's refreshing it also

delivers a nice little positive message

of racism being bad that's nothing

unique nothing that hasn't been done a

million times before but yeah it's a

nice little positive message everyone

hates the orcs in this movie because

they sided with the Dark Lord 2,000

years ago and I guess Voldemort was

terrorizing the muggle world during his

heyday and then they stopped them and

now everyone hates the orcs but one orc

becomes a police officer and he's a

fuckin great character I love joel

edgerton as that character fucking

nailed it and all of the orcs in this

movie hate him for it and they all

dressed like YouTube tough guys these

days with their loose-fitting supreme

clothing and I'm sure when they talk

orcish they're telling people to smash

that like button it was a fun universe

and all the characters were enjoyable

even though a lot of them made no sense

in this movie now if as for flaws I'll

go ahead and point them out bad writing

in a lot of places jokes that don't land

a lot and also a lot of the action and a

lot of the story is lackluster and not

very inspired there's a lot I can say in

terms of flaws but when you watch this

movie I think those flaws will just kind

of add to the cheesy fun of this movie I

also think the movies a bit too long it

starts to overstay its welcome towards

the end they could have been condensed

by about thirty minutes there's a lot of

drawn-out scenes and a lot of tired shit

in there but it's still a fun movie

let's just go ahead and pop this shit

into the moist meter I'm giving this a

60% I think it is a movie worth watching

if you want to just sit down have some

mindless fun with this movie with some

Will Smith one-liners and some nice

banter a very nice-looking world with a

very fun new premise you know how many

movies have a magic wand that's trying

to summon Voldemort not too many I

imagine it's just an enjoyable film

there's a lot of flaws here I don't

think you're gonna care about them if

you're the kind of person who just likes

some good axe

and a different take on an action-comedy

it's it's just a fun movie really I have

nothing more to say I think the critics

completely just don't understand the

idea that movies can just be fun despite

having flaws

apparently video game does magazines

understand that cuz they're giving pub G

tins all around despite that game hardly

fucking working that fucking nightmare

of a game works about as well as a

colonoscopy without an asshole and for

some reason movie critics just can't

grasp that concept that shit can be fun

even if there is some glaring flaws in

it but yeah I mean that's it so yeah

Moist Meter: Star Wars The Last Jedi

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter where we analyzed the moisture

content of the latest hottest newest

movies games and just movies and games

really today Star Wars Episode eight the

last Jedi this is a very serious moist

meter which is why I put these bad boys

on now I'd like to make it be known the

force awakens I didn't care for very

much it wasn't the worst movie I've ever

seen but it was still pretty bad rogue

one was much worse I enjoyed the ending

but that was about it so I went into

this one with pretty low expectations

and people were raving about it everyone

was very excited for it so let's just go

ahead and get right into it what did I

think of it what do I put it on the

moist meter let's find out let's go

ahead and hyper drive on in here wobble

of a dub dub on pickle Skywalker what I

really liked about this movie is the

visuals I think they did an absolutely

fantastic job with the visuals the

cinematography top fucking knotch they

introduced a lot of new little aliens

creatures and critters that I really I

enjoyed I liked those things in the

older Star Wars movies the original

three they had a lot of really cool

looking aliens that you know I found

very interesting in here they really

captured that same magic of discovering

these really cool-looking species and I

enjoyed it yeah some of them looked kind

of shitty some of them were really low

effort like they just put icicles on the

back of a fox and called it an alien but

but then there were others rows like wow

yeah that's neat oh they had a nice new

little alien there that was kind of like

a giant fucking sloppy build Oh with

nipples on it that I enjoyed that in

Luke Skywalker even milked the bad boy

drank the milk it was some alpha shit

right there really chatted it up on

screen for a little bit there Mark

Hamill and aside from just the

interesting creatures they had really

nice set pieces here the settings were

really beautiful especially towards the

end they had a snowy field type area but

it turns out it was actually salt and it

turned red so at the end of the battle

after they were blast and asked with

blasters the whole fields all red and it

looks really nice the setting all the

settings in this movie are really nice

and everything just looks great which is

to be expected of Star Wars you kind of

hope that everything looks really good

and it does they did a great job here

next thing I really liked is the

characters I really like kylo and I

really liked

ray I also enjoy post character I think

they're strong characters they're

well-written the dialogue in this movie

was just the right amount of cheese it

wasn't overblown it wasn't like house

the dead level shit it was the perfect

amount of cheese and I thought it was

good

it gets very dull at some points a lot

of conversations drag on and end with

some stupid lines but you know it's Star

Wars you expect that and then tear

another last really good thing I can say

about this movie is the action is good

there's not a whole lot of it here but

the action that is here is really good

especially the throne room scene towards

the end they have this great fight with

these red ninjas with laser beam toys

that they throw around and it's a great

fight to watch the action was really

well done

now I'm gonna talk about some shit I

didn't like I really hated the 35

fucking minute subplot with Finn and

another girl on another planet that

served no purpose at all it was probably

longer than 35 minutes it was probably

closer to 40 or 50 minutes they had this

subplot they had this grand plan and it

leads to nothing nothing happens nothing

gets accomplished absolutely nothing at

all it was so pointless had no point in

this movie it served no purpose at all

it was meaningless

it was tiresome the watch it made me

want to just fall asleep or leave the

fucking theater one of the other it was

brutal to sit through it was that bad

this whole supid subplot and you'll know

it when you get there because you'll be

thinking the same thing I guarantee it

it's just dumb it's fucking stupid they

go to the Kentucky Derby on another

planet and have a little vacation

basically and it's it's useless

absolutely useless they also kill off a

beloved character in the most awful way

they kill him and then they just don't

even talk about it they mention it one

time in an off comment Oh what happened

to important Star Wars character X

always dead to shame we lost him

that's it that's about it that he

doesn't even get like an on screen death

he kind of just gets like thrown away

like a fucking rag doll like it's like

somebody threw a doll out the window of

a moving car and it's a beloved

character and that made me super duper

fucking upset horrible decision there

absolutely horrible worse death in any

beloved character I've ever seen in any

movie super fucking awful now the next

things I want to talk about that I

really hated are going to contain

spoilers I think it's important that I

talk

about these things to justify why I

think this movie doesn't deserve a

higher score that I'm about to give it

so if you don't want anything spoiled go

ahead and skip to the end where I give

it the score if you've already seen the

movie and just want to hear why I want

to talk about these things stick around

or if you just don't give a shit about

the spoilers the Star Wars lore all

power to you listen up listen on there's

a scene where Carrie Fisher gets blown

up in the you know the main headquarters

ship the flagship and she's floating

through space she wakes up and she flies

back to the ship and she's fine so

Carrie Fisher is like Superman in a

female body an old female body just

flying around space and shit it was the

stupidest scene I've ever seen in Star

Wars and Star Wars has had some dumbass

scenes some real stinky crevices and

assholes like some real stinkers and

this scene topped them all it was the

worst scene I've seen in Star Wars

it was so fucking dumb she just

stretched her arm out like she was going

for a one-handed grab in the back of the

end zone and just flies back into the

spaceship and she's okay ridiculous

absolutely ridiculous

I mean alright it's not like she was

super perfect okay I mean she took a

two-hour nap and then was okay so I mean

she got sleepy from it as one would

expect as you're flying through fucking

space now the next one's a much bigger

complaint other than just a trivial

horrible scene it's that the majority of

this movie could have been avoided if

the Admiral that took over while leah

was in her nap time if she had just

relayed her plan to Poe if she had just

told Poe the plan Poe Finn and Rose

wouldn't have gone on that excruciating

ly boring subplot with the casino planet

which eventually led to the resistance

ships getting shot out and then the

battle going to that planet all of that

would have been avoided if the Admiral

had just told Poe that plan and she had

no reason not to her reason was

basically well Poe I didn't tell you

because fuck you you can suckle on my

clit that was what it boiled down to she

had no reason not to tell Poe what she

was planning to do if she had Poe and

you know the gang wouldn't have had that

stupid awful casino subplot they also

wouldn't have met the thief who

eventually gives the first order the

information that the resistance has

they're cloaked transport ships going to

that planet and the resistance ships

wouldn't have got blown up they wouldn't

have had to fight on that planet

everything would have been fine they

could have hid their

and bam roll credits it wouldn't have

gone the last hour and a half of this

movie wouldn't have happened if not for

the Admiral telling Poe the plan it all

would have been fine in the resistance

favor there was just some stupid

communication error it's like an anime

right before the most important thing

they want to tell the character they

just decided not to o.o tanoshii son

yeah no big deal nevermind haha let's

forget about it but if they just told

them what they wanted to tell them the

whole anime would have been you know

saved there wouldn't have been you know

wouldn't it was led to some bad shit

that could have happened in this movie

if they just told each other the fucking

plan it was stupid another awful awful

thing here is snow snow he's just such a

shitty villain here they they hyped him

up in the first movie you thought you're

gonna learn about Snoke you know they

had all this fan theory he's Darth

Plagueis well it turns out he's nobody

yeah they don't give Snoke any

explanation there is no there's no

explanation at all for who Snoke is

where he came from it's just well he's

always been there he's just he's good

with the dark side and he's just kind of

always been around we don't know

anything about him what you think we

wrote him a fucking backstory they gave

him like the Riot Games treatment Snoke

has a dark and mysterious past that's it

just stupid and so he gets killed off in

the most unglue fied way you learned

nothing about the character he was just

a shit ass villain stupid fucking dumb

there's a lot more I could pick out here

but I think I've made my point clear

that there's a lot of things a lot of

plot holes here a lot of dumb decisions

that led to this movie not being as good

as it could you know let's go ahead and

plug this bitch into the moist meter

here we're gonna clock this out of 70%

moisture this movie had a lot of

potential I think it did a lot of things

better than the previous two new movies

did I think there was a lot more it

offered it could have been a lot better

but they made some horrible decisions

there were some glaring plot holes with

such a bad villain that they didn't even

give the care to to give you any

information on they just didn't even

bother so many questions left unanswered

but there was still some fun to be had

here it's a movie worth watching if your

star wars fan it's better than the force

awakens and I'd say it's better than

rogue one that being said it's still not

a

SuperDuper awesome movie but it's it's

good it's good enough I like that a lot

of times with series the newest entry

will get slapped with it's not like the

previous ones at all this is a very

different approach to the Star Wars

universe are the very different approach

to the ex universe it's very inspired

and very different well no I disagree I

don't think this did anything super

different from previous Star Wars movies

it just did some of the things better

but it's fundamentally the same thing

you get with every Star Wars movie

except better in some places worse than

others overall though 70% movie it's

it's probably worth seeing I think it

was pretty good that's it so yeah

Moist Meter: Disaster Artist

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we'll be analyzing the

moisture content in the disaster artist

this is a movie I was really looking

forward to because the room is a movie

that's very close to my heart

it's a movie that I think about every

time I fart it is a beautiful

masterpiece of a movie now those of you

who followed me for a while now I have a

very strong passion for bad media bad

videogames bad movies bad music I love

it and I seek it out and I always have

so I saw the room around 2009/2010

somewhere in that ballpark and fell in

love absolutely fell in love with it and

by extension I fell in love with Tommy

that beautiful enigma that cosmic

anomaly that is Tommy was oh I even

watched his Let's Plays he did on the

machinima youtube channel I don't know

how many of you remember that you may

have read about it in history textbooks

at some point but it was probably for

most dear times he did this show called

the Tom ey show where he played games

and made like very short videos kind of

in the same vein as the room except with

aliens it was great I mean the only

question after watching a Tom ey show is

Tommy why are you even doing this and I

don't have the answer but I'm glad he

did he is a genius an absolute fuckin

mad genius now let's get to the movie

that is asked to artists I'm happy to

say it was a pleasant surprise and how

good it turned out what a story mark

really it was just a wholesome fun movie

to watch it wasn't like a laugh-out-loud

movie or anything like that it was just

an enjoyable experience and it's one of

the few movies I've gone to where the

audience actually participated in the

movie they tossed out memes because you

know the room has become this massive

meme I mean I wait I invested in the

room memes well before they caught on to

the mainstream kind of like see a coin

and the cryptocurrency market mark your

calendars it's gonna take off any day

now it's gonna be reaching Bitcoin

levels and months soon see a coin will

overthrow the USD but enough of the

cryptocurrency tangent it was fun having

the audience participate in the oh hi

marks you're tearing me apart Lisa as

you know the big memes and shit it was

entertaining it was just a fun movie I

want my girlfriend and she's never seen

the room and she walked away saying how

much she enjoyed the movie and that's

something I didn't really expect I

really just kind of expected this to be

marketed all

towards the hardcore meemers the people

who really like the room and those would

be the only demographic that would enjoy

the movie but it's just a good movie in

and of its own right

you don't have to see the room to enjoy

this movie I don't think it's a

gut-busting Hootin Hollerin comedy movie

but it's a good movie nonetheless it

tells a good story of friendship and

following your dreams and yeah you might

be a fucking weird creep and things

might not turn out the way you want them

to but it can still lead to something

great and you can leave your mark and

you can leave a great legacy it was a

surprisingly uplifting movie and it had

a massive cast of Hollywood juggernauts

in the comedy world Seth Rogen Brian

Cranwell Bryan Cranston is not really a

comedy actor well you know what you know

maybe he wants to be Bryan Cranston

here's a challenge for you if you're

watching make me laugh and then I'll

decide if you have a future as a comedy

actor but what I'm saying is they have

this big powerhouse cast of a list

Hollywood actors who seem to participate

in this movie just out of the pure

passion and love they have for the

original the room and it shows in their

performance they did shot-for-shot

remake of some of the scenes flawlessly

executed and it was just a really fun

entertaining movie to watch even if you

haven't seen the room it's a good

standalone self-contained not super

inside-joke heavy movie in fact it's not

really a joke heavy movie either out

argue I don't think it's a great comedy

movie but it's just a good movie to see

anyway I mean I don't really have a

whole lot of complaints everything just

kind of worked and it was fun so let's

go ahead and pop this shit into the

moist meter and check how wet it is this

is an 85-percent it was great acting

great story

uplifting fun the subject matter is one

of my favorite movies I've ever seen

which is the room it was just a really

good experience all around if you've

seen the room you've got to see this one

I would say if you haven't seen the room

you still might like this so I mean

that's it so yeah

Moist Meter: Hey Arnold Jungle Movie

initiating moisture that beautiful

rendition of the Hey Arnold theme song

has undoubtably opened a floodgate of

nostalgia into your penises and they're

sailing at full mast no doubt in my mind

about that but only 90s kids remember

the gym that was Hey Arnold does anybody

else 90s kids only 90s kids will get

this welcome to the moist meter nineties

kids where we're going back in time back

to the fourth grade back before we knew

where babies came from and back before

our uncles were in jail for theft we are

looking at Hey Arnold the jungle movie a

movie that brings closure to a series 15

years in the making it's a name you

probably heard in the past there was a

lot of mystery surrounding the jungle

movie because Hey Arnold ended on a

cliffhanger with his parents wondering

where they were but the movie never got

made despite the script being completely

finished it was rip roarin hurtin and

squirt and ready for action but

Nickelodeon shit it on it and we didn't

see it for some reason no one knew why

there's a lot of theories around the

internet and that maybe it was an act by

the reptilians trying to take away our

beloved 90s cartoons

taking away the power from the 90s kidz

a bold move from the reptilians but they

weren't strong enough because the jungle

movie has finally come out I'm sure

you've heard of it if you've been going

to church every Sunday the Lord has

blessed us with the movie the actual

fucking movie and it absolutely was not

a disappointment the movie was great it

had a satisfying ending it wrapped the

series up beautifully they got all of

the original voice actors back for this

which really brought it all to life

15-year anus and you still find the same

fucking voice actors it's amazing I

guess they're doing nothing but waiting

for hey Arnold to come back they brought

back damn near every character even a

character that did nothing but clean up

puke on the fucking fourth-grade floor

one time in episode 14 of season 3 was

in this movie with the original voice

actor who played janitorial janitorial

staff number three it was great and the

whole movie was the best episode of Hey

Arnold

it really captured what made the series

is a whole great in an hour in 30

minutes it was enjoyable it wrapped

everything up it had a really satisfying

conclusion and everything leading up to

it was fun to watch the gang was back at

it and you know

in there shit I really have no

complaints about this movie at all that

being said it's not like this perfect

movie or masterpiece that all of you

need to get out of bed right now and go

subscribe to Nickelodeon online on the

man fire stick Nickelodeon deck or

anything like that to watch the movie

but if you've seen Hey Arnold and you

wanted you know the answer what happened

to his parents what's going on how does

it all end this wraps it all up and it

does it perfectly it's a real passion

project and it shows I took this

opportunity capitalized on it and really

wrapped it all up in a very satisfying

way so let's just go ahead and pop this

shit into the moist minute because I

don't have a whole lot of criticism for

this movie I'm giving this an 80% it's

an 80% because you know it's not a

masterpiece or a perfect movie but it's

a great trip down memory lane that's fun

to see all the characters again the

nostalgia is just overwhelming and it's

a movie you can't help but smile out if

you're familiar with this series it's a

lot of fun to watch and a lot not many

people are talking about the jungle

movie despite all the hype over the last

15 years I'm assuming it's because

Nickelodeon hasn't done a super great

job at really getting the word out that

it's finally you know available or

anything but have you've seen hey Arnold

it's definitely worth at least seeing

how it ends so that's a yeah

Moist Meter: CoD WW2

initiating moisture another year another

Call of Duty which means another flood

of teenagers going online to tell you

that they fucked your mother

this year's Call of Duty takes place in

World War two what's called Call of Duty

World War two I'm gonna break this

review up into three parts a campaign

part a multiplayer part in a zombies

part because I feel like there are three

different games entirely for the most

part so let's talk about the worst

component of this entire game the

campaign the campaign is the most

miserable gaming experience I've had in

2017 I stream the whole thing start to

finish it took about five hours and a

little bit of change and it is an

abysmal repugnant putrid a stain of a

storyline by the end of this game I felt

like an actual soldier in World War two

just miserable drained and having PTSD

from having played this campaign it's

just pure rectum grease the voice acting

is fuckin stellar though the acting is

really really good although they're

working with dog anus for a script the

graphics are mind-blowing absolutely

stunning graphics when it comes to the

pre-rendered cutscenes and really just

all of the game is beautiful looking

except there's a whole lot of Grey's

here for the most part but I mean really

the graphics are good overall really

really good it's just the gate the

missions it's not the gameplay the

gameplay is fine it's just like every

other Call of Duty put the missions holy

fuck they're so bad and the writing is

the worst I've seen in a triple-a game

this year the writing is some of the

absolute worst the most predictable

story the most awfully designed

characters all of them 2d nothing good

about the characters and all the fucking

missions are the same it's either get on

this turret and defend wave after wave

stand in this spot and defend this

location for X amount of minutes or an

on-rails shooter where you get in a tank

or something and just shoot while going

in one direction that you're forced to

go down it's so boring it's no fun at

all I would have rather been picking

smegma out of my asshole

I've been saying a lot about ass a lot

of ass references here it's because the

entire campaign reminds me of every

component of an ass it was just no fun

at all now all this being said about the

campaign I can see why Call of Duty fans

would enjoy

and I can see why kids would enjoy it I

know kids and Call of Duty fans are

synonymous but I'm saying I can

definitely understand from an objective

standpoint why they would like this

there's a lot of jingling Keys

explosions blood I get why they would

like it somebody who hasn't played a

video game ever in their life will like

this campaign but if you would play if

you have played any video game you will

not like this campaign this would be

good in 2007 it is not good in 2017

unless you're called duty fan a kid or

someone who's never picked up a game

before now let's move on to the next

part the thing that people actually play

Call of Duty for the multiplayer nobody

fuckin plays the campaign at all nobody

they play it for the multiplayer so

let's talk about that how is the

multiplayer yeah it's like every other

Call of Duty except the ones where they

introduced titanfall type mechanics

there's not a whole lot of movement

things here it's like an older Call of

Duty plays exactly the same nothing

innovative nothing new plays like Call

of Duty feels like Call of Duty if you

like Call of Duty's multiplayer from

previous years you will like this

multiplayer that's about all I can say

about it there's really not a whole lot

of depth to go in here I'm sure all of

you watching this have played a call of

duty at some point and if you have play

to call of duty at some point you have

basically played this one as well if you

liked what you played back then you'll

like this one it's that and then it's

kind of improved in certain areas but

it's fundamentally exactly the same and

Nazi Zombies is honestly fun I've always

enjoyed the nazi zombie mini game and

this one's no different it is fun it's

just like the other ones no massive

improvements no massive differences and

it's just fucking fun now let's take all

of the ingredients here and put them

into a beaker and add our chemical X

which is the moist meter and we'll

create the perfect little moisture

content analyzer this is a 65% on the

moist meter everything in the game works

and it's exactly like the previous games

so it's functional it's got an

established formula that works well and

it's an above average game now it's not

my personal cup of cum it's not a game

I'm going to play any longer now that I

put over 20-some hours into it to really

get into it to have a fair opinion of it

but I can sit back and objectively say

that yes this would be about a 65% I can

see who would like this I could see why

they would like this I can see why it's

popular but for me it's not a game I

enjoy so yeah that's it too

Moist Meter: Thor Ragnarok

initiating moisture hi and welcome to

the latest installment in the sodden

cinematic universe today we'll be

analyzing the moisture content in the

new Thor movie called thor ragnarok full

disclosure I think the previous two Thor

movies were stinky ass I think they're

by far the weakest in the MCU but I

still went into this movie with high

expectations and wasn't let down the

movie trailers try to sell you that this

is a different approach to a standard

superhero action flick and for the most

part they're right this is a pretty

different approach it's a more comedic

approach a different visual style for

the most part as well and it is pretty

different from most of the others until

it gets to the end then it kind of falls

into cliches and what you'd expect but

it doesn't well enough where that's not

a big complaint this movies about 80%

great 10% what we've seen a million

times and a hundred percent reason to

remember the name it is a really fun

movie to watch especially when it comes

to comedy there was a lot of comic bits

throughout this entire movie and they

did it surprisingly well I've talked

about this before but I'm not one to

laugh out loud during comedy movies or

anything like that occasionally I'll

blow a little light load out of my nose

during a scene or something but for the

most part I find modern comedy movies to

be about as enjoyable as watching your

beloved cat get run over by a fucking

steamroller

however this movie actually surprised me

with how decently the comedy was

executed here I'm not saying I was

laughing out loud having a hoot and a

holler the whole time rolling down the

aisle pissing my trousers laughing or

anything like that but it actually got

me giggling quite a bit there was one

character that introduced here who's

perhaps one of my favorite in the entire

MCU called Korg I thought cord was just

so fucking great he was a purely comic

relief character who did comic relief

really well and the comedy wasn't the

only surprisingly good element here the

visuals were a bit different to what

you're accustomed to seeing in modern

superhero movies and really modern

movies in general since everything has

this trend of trying to be super dark

and gritty and shit this movie was very

colourful and it had a different style

than most other MCU movies especially

one that stood out to me is during a

flashback where Valkyries how to

showdown with the main antagonist it was

beautiful absolutely beautiful the whole

movie just looked really

and very different from most of the

other ones in my personal opinion

now the story isn't super strong but

it's not weak either it's just

predictable and that's not a big

complaint or anything it's a fucking

superhero movie you can't expect it to

reinvent the condom with some type of

groundbreaking story it's a very decent

story and it's told very well and it's

the first standalone MCU movie that I

feel will have an actual impact on the

MCU universe as a whole

whereas other MCU standalone films like

Iron Man 3 don't feel like they have any

way at all you know they have the main

hero just go off on this side adventure

that doesn't feel important you know he

goes to the local diner where a madman

selling chicken wings that are too spicy

the astoundingly high Scoville poses a

threat to tastebuds all over the world

overloading these taste buds the hero

stops him yippee it was a fun adventure

while it lasted but it doesn't have any

weight in that universe this movie has a

whole lot of shit that happens that I

feel will have a huge impact on that

universe and it's fucking great now the

villain I think is a good villain she

didn't have a whole lot of screen time

here to really develop in my opinion but

she was played very well by Cate

Blanchett and I thought she was super

cool but they kind of shoehorned in an

undead zombie army which was kind of

fucking lame in my opinion but overall I

think she could be a cool villain if we

see her again and she's more fleshed out

and I might as well at least touch on it

soundtracks good I never really have a

whole lot to say about soundtrack unless

it really Wow's me or really disappoints

me and makes me feel bad about myself or

even hearing that music this movie ran

that middle ground where it was good it

was you know it was maybe no complaints

it was fun to listen to let's go ahead

and pop this shit into the moist meter

here

I'm giving thor ragnarok and 85% it was

a genuinely fun movie to sit through the

entire audience loved it all the comedy

bits really hit pretty hard with the

audience I was in and even got a little

giggle out of me here and there Korg had

a one-liner that actually gave me a bit

of a hoot so that was a surprise since I

don't typically laugh at movies like I

said earlier and the whole movie was

just a fun ride to go on and it felt

like I'd had a real wait in the MCU

easily the best Thor movie while the

previous two Thor movies just ate shit

hole this movie pounded shit hole with a

lot of fun in there that was meant as a

compliment but I realized saying shit

hole in a positive way doesn't exactly

convey the idea of something being

so just know the last two movies ate

shit

this movie was serving out shit and it

was good shit I enjoyed it

that's it see ya

Moist Meter: Wolfenstein 2

initiating moisture here's something the

history books won't tell ya the moist

meter was what truly defeated the Nazis

all those years ago no today we'll be

looking at Wolfenstein 2 which explores

an alternate timeline well the moist

meter was never invented and the Nazis

won the war in the game he plays BJ

blaskowitz who pretty much

single-handedly takes on the entire Nazi

regime the other characters that support

BJ never actually do anything in the

battlefield they just kind of stay back

at home base eat sleep and jerk off

except BJ's lover

Anja she's on the frontlines constantly

and she's basically a female pregnant

Jason Bourne

an absolute badass she has two twins

growing inside her and she uses that

inflated stomach full of to human life

forms that's basically a bulletproof

vest but aside from her the rest of the

cast here they don't actually contribute

on the front lines very much but the

game is fucking fun it is really well

written all of the characters are

likable and they each have really unique

personalities that feel alive and you

really start liking the characters and

hating the bad guys and they make the

bad guys is over the top awful as they

possibly could which isn't really that

hard considering they're Nazis so it's

not very difficult to make Nazis

extremely hateable but all the

characters were pretty well written and

the main game was well-written as well

the story was good and the game seemed

very self-aware it knew it was

over-the-top and it wanted to relish

that fact it wanted to be as

over-the-top as it could possibly be I

will say though I think some of the

cutscenes dragged on there may have been

an overload of them the game took me

seven and a half to eight hours to

complete and about five of those hours

were spent watching cutscenes or just

listening the dialogue which isn't bad

since it was all well written but it

still leads to a pacing issue where you

have this over-the-top really fun

gunplay action segments testosterone

flowing out the asshole and then you go

to a pretty slow cutscene and then

another cutscene and then another

cutscene and then you're back in the

action 30 minutes later it just kind of

makes it feel less awesome even though

the cutscenes in the writing are great I

think there should have been more actual

gameplay and action and the gameplay is

fucking great that's why I definitely

want more of it the gunplay was Fanta

the game made you feel like this awesome

badass even the first level does a great

job of selling you that you are a fuckin

badass you roll around on a wheelchair

just eliminating Nazis annihilating them

in a fucking wheelchair like you're Tony

Hawk doing stunts down the stairs while

firing in all directions it's just

fucking fun to play the game and another

thing that was really great is the

levels the levels did a great job of

keeping everything fresh the setting

kept changing and what you were supposed

to do in the level kept changing and it

was really nice one minute you're on

earth enjoying a milkshake with a fire

extinguisher nuclear bomb next next

second you're on Venus to act in a Nazi

propaganda film in front of Adolf Hitler

the game knew how to keep things fresh

and interesting so nothing got stale or

overstayed its welcome the game was like

a nice fresh loaf of bread that stayed

constantly fresh and warm instead of

becoming that fuckin piece of cardboard

the next day another thing that I really

enjoyed was the soundtrack the music fit

well throughout the entire game and it

just made the game that much cooler with

this cum inducing soundtrack now as for

some complaints I have about the game I

think the main hub world where you

explore gets side missions and shit and

just talk to the crew was uninspired

it was labyrinthian and it kind of got

difficult to find your way around the

ship even as you got towards the end of

the game you'd still have a hard time

remembering where the ammo Depot was

where max is where my girl Rosa was at I

needed to feed her potatoes so she got

nice and strong but half the time I

couldn't find her really that whole area

was just lackluster and under whelming I

also don't really like how the game

ended this is a game that existed purely

to make a sequel they had that in mind

the whole time but what they failed to

realize is that in making a game to set

up a sequel you have to at least give

the player some sense of accomplishment

in this game it doesn't really feel like

you accomplished all that much I

obviously think a lot got accomplished

and it pushes the story forward quite a

bit but you know take for example halo 2

by the end of halo 2 you feel like

you've made a big big impact on the

story even though you know there's gonna

be a next one and this game just didn't

have that sense of accomplishment in my

opinion so let's go ahead and pop this

into the same machine that took down the

Nazis in the first place the moist meter

I'm giving this an 80% and I already

know is gonna be people in the comments

what only an 80% this man must eat

asshole out of his asshole going against

the grain of the

mainstream game reviewers that give this

a nine out of ten and he only had two or

three main complaints and gives it an

eighty he must just be trying to be edgy

and cool

well troglodyte just because there's not

a whole lot of complaints doesn't mean I

think this game is an absolute must by

divine gift a humanity that deserves a 9

or higher I think it's a very fun game

that I enjoyed greatly but it's not a

game that I feel was groundbreaking or

push the envelope and everyone in the

world should play at some point but it

is a very fun game that people that like

a competent FPS would very much enjoy

and I think most people will like the

writing in this game this game has a lot

to offer people who enjoy a good

single-player experience that's not

marred by awful microtransactions and

just like some high testosterone

over-the-top action so yeah that's it

so yeah

Moist Meter: Jigsaw

initiating moisture waste meter jigsaw

those are two different words with two

very different meanings but today

they'll collide in the Thunderdome when

I analyzed the moisture content of the

new jigsaw movie this is the first new

Scylla movie in seven years after the

series started to fall apart and become

this fermenting shit stain on the movie

industry used to have yearly releases I

saw kind of like Call of Duty with about

the same amount of quality and then

decided to take a seven-year hiatus but

have they learned anything with this new

entry not really it's pretty

underwhelming so the biggest problem is

it's full of plot holes there's plot

holes out the asshole in this movie also

you just have to accept that jigsaw is

omniscient he knows everything he's like

Santa Claus he's made a list he checks

it twice he knows who's naughty or nice

he knows everything you've done he knows

every time you've jerked off he knows

where you've hidden your cum he knows it

all and he'll use it against you it's

kind of reaching with how much knowledge

he has it's pretty unrealistic but I

guess the series doesn't really go for

something super realistic which is

excusable

another major complaint I have about

this movie is it the same one I had

about the new Death Note movie everyone

is like a balloon of meat that's just

one small inconvenience away from

popping in a gory explosion if somebody

accidentally gets a toothpick in their

hand their whole hands coming right the

fuck off it's just laughable points

especially at one scene in the movie

where two cars collide in the second

there's an impact they both explode and

an extravagant explosion like someone

dropped a fucking nuke on them it's just

laughable I'd already mentioned the plot

holes and I need a ream inch and that

because there's a lot of fucking plot

holes here in this story it's pretty

decent actually I think the story itself

is pretty interesting and the twists at

the end are not bad some of them you can

kind of see coming but it leaves so many

questions that you just not gonna get an

answer to and your staff to accept they

forgot about it and there it's your

answer they just forgot and they don't

have an answer for you the games are

also pretty underwhelming there's

nothing too unique about the games

they've also toned down the gore a lot

for better for worse but the games are

the biggest problem with it it's just

not very interesting the game's kind of

fucking suck in my opinion there's also

some bad CG that's thrown in there that

all

immediately take you right out of it and

really while I do think the plot is

decent it's nothing to saw movies

haven't done before it's kind of a

combined plot from two different saw

movies I don't want to say which two cuz

then you'll immediately guess what's

going on in this movie but it's nothing

new it's just done decently but with a

ton of fucking plot holes I can't make

that point enough there is a lot of plot

holes in this movie is it worth seeing I

don't know if you're a fan of the Saw

movies you probably won't like this if

you don't like the Saw movies but you

like horror movies and it's not really

much of a horror movie

you might like this I mean there's

really not a whole lot else to say so I

want to play a game where we analyze the

moisture content of this movie by

popping it in the state of the art moist

meter it's a 30 percent it's it's an

alright movie I think there's some

redeeming qualities of it and it

definitely changes a little bit from the

sauce areas with the tone and the

visuals but nothing too exciting that's

gonna make you jump onto your seat and

put pee pee in your trousers while

applauding the movie for doing something

so new and great it's an alright movie

it's a Saw movie you get kind of what

you expect but a lot less of it and

that's about it so yeah

Moist Meter: The Snowman

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today I'll be analyzing the

moisture content found within the movie

the Snowman there's not a lot of

moisture content found within the movie

at the Snowman this movie's abominable

it's a fuckin abominable snowman I'm

gonna go head and get my favorite part

of this movie out of the way right now

it's the main characters name boss

Bender's character's name it's hairy

hole it's a fucking fantastic name for a

character it was also my nickname

throughout high school since I was known

for my hairy chocolate starfish now in

this movie hairy holes got a very

difficult case to crack and almost as

difficult as his case is watching this

movie this movie is a convoluted mess an

absolute dumpster fire of editing it's

truly horrible nothing flows together

well at all

one second hairy holes investigating

something it's pretty straightforward

and makes sense and then the next scene

is a lady falling around the mayor of

Oslo who's taking pictures of some

titties

there was no lead-up to it no

explanation for it and when it happens

it's never talked about again it's like

this movie was filmed over top of

someone's home movie and they forgot to

edit that part out there was just no

reason for it it served no purpose and

that's just kinda how this movie works

it goes from one scene to the next and

there's really no relation between the

two scenes for the most part you know

from after taking pictures of the

titties I don't remember what scene came

next but I'm sure it was something

equally as out of place probably just

playing fucking finger puppets for an

elementary school somewhere in Oslo the

movie just had horrible editing it made

it just unpleasant to watch the story

itself could have been interesting it

had an interesting premise and I really

liked the setting and the visuals were

pretty good as well but that's all I

have good to say about this everything

else was awful they had so many little

subplots that didn't play a role they

had a really great cast of actors and

actresses but they didn't utilize them

they just they just didn't do anything

with them it was just really horribly

done Val Kilmer's in this movie and he's

redubbed and the redub is so bad it's

such an out of place read dubbing it

sounds like some type of anime fanfic

that's commentated on youtube by a group

of teens it's just it's some of the

worst I've seen and the sound editing is

also really bad some things that are

supposed to be loud or supposed to have

a certain sound sound like some type of

8-bit video game sound effect it's it's

horrible

it's some of the worst sound editing and

dubbing I've ever heard in a

professional production it's really

really bad but the worst thing about it

is just how how messy it is because

there's really no relation from one

scene to the next and it doesn't do a

good job of explaining the thought

process behind the investigation here

they just kind of make these wild

assumptions and then just get somewhere

and get closer to it you even forget

some of the characters names throughout

the movie because they say the

characters names as if you're supposed

to already be familiar with them like

you're supposed to have already read

this book this movies about and they

only say the character's name once and

then they become an important character

but never say the name again so you

don't even know who the fuck that is you

have to refer to that character as bald

man or some other embarrassingly simple

caveman type name beard man in chair

number three because I didn't give him a

fucking name more than once it's just a

really badly made movie the book I hear

is super great I never read the book but

I hear the book is better than the movie

what you hear every single time there's

a movie made about a book but it'd be

hard for this book to be worse than this

movie it's really really bad I mean

there's really not a whole lot more to

say about this the only good things is

the name Harry Hole and that's just more

of a joke good thing than anything but

the setting is nice I think the setting

of oslo is really nice and the visuals

are pretty well well-done but everything

else is just super fucking bad horrible

sound horrible horrible put together

story with and it had like a decent

premise but it was just so badly put

together you know fuck it let's just go

right into the moist meter this is a

twenty-percent there's really not a

whole lot more that needs to be said

about it the movie is just a mess and

you can tell that it was really rushed

and based on what I've read there's a

lot of Sheen's that a lot of scenes they

didn't shoot so they had a lot of

inconsistencies and they had to change

it around and completely fuck things up

and editing and it shows in this movie

this is just a lot of wasted potential

with this and it's not really worth

seeing as it's so bad it's good movie

either and that's it

so yeah

Moist Meter: Evil Within 2

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter today we'll be analyzing the

moisture within the evil within -

there's not a whole lot of evil within

here and there's not a whole lot of

moisture within here either I don't mean

to immediately spoil that off the bat

but I've been reading the reviews for

this game and everyone's giving it like

an 8 out of 10 I wholeheartedly disagree

with that and I really just can't

understand what could have warranted

that high of a score for this game

I think it's an enjoyable game but it's

just barely above average with a ton of

flaws now it seems that every reviewing

outlet is just comparing it to the first

evil within which I really enjoyed and

it seems all the reviewing outlets are

echoing the same thing it's better than

the predecessor in this area in that

area so here's an 8 out of 10 and 9 out

of 10 but it's all in regards to the

previous game not as an actual game

itself it's just better than the last

one so we're gonna give it a higher

score and I think that's really

misleading because there's a lot of

problems with this game I think it's

still enjoyable but there's definitely

objectively a lot wrong

the first being uninspired voice acting

the voice acting is just laughably bad

at some points a lot of times it feels

like I'm playing house of the Dead and

listening the Goldmann talked to me that

there's certain times where I felt you

know I can do a better job and when I do

voice acting and I hear that shit back

I'd rather be listening to a fucking

urine stream hitting a toilet bowl and

it's enough to really take you out of

the experience and the game supposed to

really be an emotional journey but the

voice acting turns it into this comedy

experience and the script doesn't do it

any favors the dialogue can be so

laughably bad it feels like some

twelve-year-old wearing a trench coat

was trying to think of some edgy lines

and they threw him in here and it just

comes across so flat and bad and the

main story really isn't that bad there's

a lot of pacing issues but the story

overall is exciting it's interesting and

it's different which I always welcome

but it's really held back by some truly

horrible dialogue and awful voice acting

they would have been better off just

doing a banjo kazooie route and just

having grunts for all the characters

than having the actors they had in here

just have him fucking farting into the

mic at different pitches that would have

been better the voice acting really was

just one of the worst things about the

title especially towards the end that's

when the voice acting really rears

ugly Hedden starts their own small dicks

into the glory hole there's a really

emotional scene where the main character

sebastian does something really

traumatic and his response was just a

simple no honored with the same

intensity and emotion I would give if I

accidentally spilt a little water on my

kitchen floor now aside from just bad

writing bad voice-acting another thing

that was really not great about this

game was the gameplay and I'm seeing a

lot of praise for it from the reviewing

outlets because they're comparing it to

the first one which was mechanically not

great and I will say the gameplay has

improved over the first one but that

doesn't mean it's good I mean it's like

comparing you know you last four seconds

during sex and then the next time you

last five yeah its improvement but that

doesn't make it that great either so the

gameplay is very stiff it's very clunky

the gunplay not great there's a crafting

system in here some upgrades that are

very bare-bones I see a lot of praise

for him but they're extremely bare-bones

they're very simple stuff here's a point

you get a little health here's a point

you get some stamina here's a point you

sneak around a little better there's

nothing really creative about their

upgrades the weapons are the same here's

a little firepower here's a little ammo

clip there's nothing really interesting

about it every time you get into an

intense firefight and then you have to

reload you don't have any way of dodging

or doing anything special to get out of

there so you have to do like your old

man jog out of the way that just a

little water that looks like you shit

your pants 9 times out of 10 you're

still going to get hit not that that's

necessarily a bad thing it's your fault

for getting into that poor position that

poor situation you should have been a

little sneakier and the game encourages

stealth and the stealth is sound the

stealth is pretty well done but when you

do get into a firefight it is not it's

not great it's really not you end up

just functioning like Bastion from

overwatch and you have to sit there

shoot your clip and then wait a couple

of seconds before your character can

respond to do an animation to run away

another thing I see a lot of praise for

on the game is its level design I think

the level design is probably 10 times

weaker than the first evil within and

that was far more linear the levels here

are all exactly the same here's a few

pieces of cover hide behind it wait for

one of the zombies to go around you

sneak kill it

there's no puzzles to really be solved

there's no puzzles at all really I think

there was two throughout the whole game

and they were very very simple and the

level design was always the same go

right go straight go right

go straight the whole time and then you

hide behind cover whenever you see

enemies and just wait for him there was

nothing special about the level design

it wasn't inventive as a lot of review

outlets are claiming now let's get to

some things I liked about the game and a

lot of things I can agree with with the

other reviewers out there the atmosphere

of this game is fantastic I love the

little haunting atmosphere they have

going on Union as a as a setting is

really nice and interesting and I think

one of the main villains the artist is

fantastic hunting him led to some really

memorable moments a lot of really cool

set pieces and a lot of awesome

environments the artist definitely was

the best part of the story and the best

part of just playing through the game

there's also a certain charm to playing

this game and the story is good enough

to make you want to finish it and see

how it ends even though there's quite a

few plot holes in there I also really

enjoyed the soundtrack to this game the

music was absolutely beautiful

especially at the end of the game truly

just a fantastic fit for the tone

everything just kind of fit with what

was going on music was truly an amass of

improvement over the last one just

fantastic score here there's also quite

a bit of content here it took me ten and

a half hours to beat the game and that

was without playing a whole ton of side

missions I also didn't even find all of

the weapons either so there's a lot to

do and a lot to find within Union here

and there should be because this is a

$60 price tag so there should be a lot

of content now let's pop this shit into

the moist meter I'm giving this a 55%

like I said I feel it's a barely above

average game it's enjoyable but it has a

ton of flaws to it and it's also not

really a survival horror type of game

it's more of an action type of game if

you're someone who enjoys a more

old-school experience and doesn't mind

clunky controls and a lot of different

superficial problems you'll probably

enjoy this and if you're a fan of

Resident Evil games you'll definitely

probably enjoy this one but from a

purely objective standpoint I really

can't understand how every single

reviewer out there is giving it anywhere

from an 8 to 9 and everything in between

I haven't seen anything even below an 8

for this game yet and I just don't

understand it because there's such

glaring issues with this game in every

possible department yes it's still a fun

game to play and yes there is

improvements over the first one but that

doesn't make it an 8 or 9 game even

compared to the last one I don't

the improvements are that that

significant in fact I almost prefer the

first game for the most part oh yeah

anyway that's it see ya

Moist Meter: The Foreigner

initiating moisture here moist meter

headquarters were all about practical

pranks and surprises the biggest one we

pulled so far is this one right now

because this is a back-to-back moist

meter I just I just finished the one for

happy deathday and now I'm doing one for

the foreigner because I saw both movies

back to back so I figured let's do him

back-to-back and you had no idea if I

didn't say anything that this has been

right after I finished happy deathday

it's quite it's quite the elaborate hoax

so the foreigner is it good how much

moisture is there in there and it's

pretty fucking what I left with sodden

panties the story you can pretty much

get from the trailers Jackie Chan loses

his daughter in a bombing from

terrorists and he thinks Pierce Brosnan

knows who did it and he wants the names

so then he sets out on this mission for

a revenge and he becomes this this angel

of death but he doesn't really kill

anyone at least not until it really

starts going but he is this mastermind

he's always a step ahead of everyone but

he's not an invincible superhero he

still gets his ass kicked the action is

great but it's more of a political drama

and it's a lot of people that might turn

you off but it's really well done and

it's really interesting to watch all of

these plot points unfold and the great

plot is held by fantastic performances

from Pierce Brosnan and Jackie Chan

Pierce Brosnan plays James Bond who's

gone undercover as an Irish government

official and Jackie Chan plays a demigod

and it's fucking awesome to watch Jackie

Chan get to pierce in this movie you

know one second Pierce Brosnan is just

going down in the kitchen for a nice

cereal nice bowl of cereal he opens a

cereal box nope Jackie Chan's replace it

with asbestos and he has a note in there

and saying he wants some fucking names

fucking awesome throughout the entire

movie and the ending is so satisfying

really the plot was so good and I didn't

expect it to be as good as it was I

thought it was just gonna be a little

cliche action movie and there's there is

quite a bit of action but the political

drama side of things is what really will

draw you in

and it's just so well done the

soundtrack and everything just it's

forgettable I don't know why I even

bother mentioning soundtrack I think

from now on in moist meters I only

mentioned soundtrack if it's actually

fucking good because most movies they

don't they don't really do anything too

special with a soundtrack that I mean

there's some standouts out there like

Blade Runner 2049 but you know ok don't

go there expecting a great soundtrack

you're not gonna get any big boner jams

but what you will get is a movie you're

probably not expecting when you see

Jackie Chan as the leading name on a

movie you're expecting a Jackie Chan

movie and with a Jackie Chan movie

you're expecting a certain dose of

Jackie Chan vitamin J see a recommended

doctor daily dose of Jackie Chan per

Jackie Chan movie in this movie Jackie

Chan is not the main character he's

still a big role in here but he's more

of not exactly a supporting character

but he's just more of kind of that guy

who's on a mission and he's a subplot

the main show here is Pierce Brosnan and

what's going on in the political side of

things and what it all means for Pierce

bras and then his career as a politician

and it's not bad because it's well done

but if you're going there expecting

Jackie Chan whooping some ass and get

making men rimjob each other and shit

you're not gonna get that here the

action is there and it's it's good but

it's not Jackie Chan action so if that's

what you're expecting I have no doubt

you'll be let down but if you go into

this movie kind of with an open mind and

like okay I'm going to get a story heavy

political drama type of movie and I'm

also gonna get to watch Jackie Chan whup

some ass then you'll probably be pretty

satisfied with what you see here the

movie does have quite a few flaws though

at least in terms of pacing and it also

seems like they kind of didn't know what

kind of tone they wanted to go for what

story they really wanted to tell it

seemed like really two movies put

together you know for one part they seem

to want to focus on Jackie Chan and him

wanting revenge and it makes it feel

like okay we're gonna watch Jackie Chan

outsmart these people and kick a whole

bunch of dickhole inside out and you

know we're seeing a lot of revenge shit

for a little while and then it switches

entirely to the political thriller side

things where we don't even see Jackie

and he's only mentioned briefly every

now and then and then by the end of the

movie it seems like Jackie Chan's

character was just pushed to the side

until they remembered Oh Jackie Chan

still in this movie let's kind of

shoehorn him in here and then they kind

of have Jackie come back in out of

nowhere and then once he's out once he's

out of it again at the very end of the

movie he just again comes out of nowhere

and it just doesn't seem like they know

what to do with Jackie by the end of the

movie because they had already lost the

revenge direction they had already

focused so heavily on the political side

of things when Jackie Chan does come

back in it's like oh shit I forgot he

was still on this mission wasn't he and

it's kind of a shame because if they had

set on one straight tone throughout the

movie they could have had something a

lot better I think but kind of meshing

the two falls apart towards the end it's

still a good movie let's go ahead and

pop this shit into the moist meter I'm

gonna give this an 80% I really enjoyed

it for what it was I thought it did it

it did a good job of telling a story and

it also had some action to back it up

that was interesting the characters were

really well done by Jackie and Pierce

Brosnan and I just had fun watching this

movie and that's yeah that's it

Moist Meter: Happy Death Day

initiating moisture welcome to another

exciting episode of do I need a haircut

where we answer the question do I need a

haircut and the answer is a resounding

yes on this week's episode now before I

can get a haircut

I must analyze the moisture content of

the movie happy deathday it's a movie

that just came out and I just saw it the

movie is a simple premise very similar

to Groundhog Day but with a slasher

twist it's basically the dark souls of

Groundhog Day movies the story is simple

enough a lady gets killed and then she

keeps repeating the day over and over

again until she can solve her own murder

the story takes a little bit of twists

and turns here and there it's got a nice

little romance subplot too there's

nothing special about this story here

really there's nothing special about the

whole movie but everything it does it

does pretty well and it's enjoyable now

I will say one of my biggest complaints

is there is a severe lack of $0.50 in

this movie the trailers really hyped it

up with the 50 cent song and I was kind

of disappointed that it turns out it's

not even in the movie I don't mean to

spoil it if you're going to see it for

the 50 cent soundtrack you will be

disappointed now it also does a really

decent job of making it hard to guess

who the killer is you know one second

you think you've figured it all out it

has to be this person but then it turns

out it's fucking Colonel Mustard in the

study with the nipple clamps it does a

good job of keeping you guessing even

when you're a hundred percent sure you

know who it is it throws a curveball at

you it's really just it's a pleasant

movie to see in a very odd way - it's a

cute movie when they when the credits

roll you Paul I have a smile on your

face it kind of markets itself as more

of a horror movie which it absolutely is

not there's some weak-ass jump scares

they try the shoehorn in there they

don't work the movie just does not work

as a horror movie it's this very very

kind of self-aware movie that it knows

it's not doing anything special but it's

going to do it well and it and it knows

it's not special even makes a direct

reference to Groundhog Day and is it's

just a nice breath of fresh air it's

just here's a movie that's not taking

itself too seriously and it's fun to

watch you know the the comedy bits

weren't bad

the acting from almost all the

characters is pretty good dialog wasn't

shitty everything just worked pretty

fucking well so I don't have a whole lot

to say about this movie other than I saw

a ton of people going to see this

tonight Friday the 13th because you know

they think it's a horror movie let's go

see something spooky for Friday the 13th

I have no doubt they are not getting

what they're what they're expecting

that's not a bad thing I think they'll

still be satisfied with it but I want to

make it very clear I don't think this

movie is anything super special nor is

it something you need to rush right out

throw on your best pair of shoes and go

see but if you're just looking for a fun

movie an even kind of cute movie to see

cutes not the right word I wouldn't

exactly take your grandparents and your

children there but just a laid back

movie to see I would definitely

recommend this one there's just not a

whole lot to say it's just Pleasant this

isn't at all me saying there's nothing

wrong with this movie there's definitely

a lot of flaws here the biggest one

being when you do find out who the

killer is a lot of things with the story

kind of just don't add up it just kind

of it kind of throws this monkey wrench

in there where things just the dots

don't start connecting you're connecting

dots and you're just getting a big

fucking dick on your piece of paper with

the dots and that's not that big a deal

I can't even feel in the writing process

they noticed that and they're like yeah

you know Franklin you know this doesn't

work who gives a fuck and you know it's

a good attitude to have with a movie

like this who gives a fuck they did

everything decent enough the flaws in

this movie don't really hold it back

from being the best it could be in what

it tried to do so let's go ahead and

blow out these candles here and wish

that I was about three inches taller so

I'm gonna plug this into the moist meter

now it is a 65% there's really nothing

special about this movie but it is a

movie that's just kind of fun to see

you're not gonna walk away from there

like holy shit I just I just saw

something big you're gonna walk away

saying you know what I enjoyed that hour

and a half and yeah I mean that really

is all there is to say about that movie

so yeah

Moist Meter: Shadow of War

initiating moisture j.r.r tolkien is

widely considered a pioneer in

literature but one thing the historians

failed to touch on one thing that just

kind of squeaked through the cracks that

only recently has been on earth is one

of JRR tolkien x'

most ambitious goals that he never saw a

chief he aimed to create the world's

most accurate moisture content analyzer

but alas his mission failed

however we here at moist meter

headquarters have picked up his dream

and brought it to fruition we've made it

a reality the world's most accurate

moisture content analyzer and today on

that shopping caucus Middle Earth shadow

of war now the first and most important

thing I want to touch about on this game

is the most controversial thing

surrounding this release and that is the

loot box system that they've included

for no fucking reason other than just

making some quick money now for those of

you who don't know about loot boxes I'm

kidding all of you know about loot boxes

I'm not going to give you the down-low

so the way the loot boxes in this game

work is you have a couple to choose from

such as a gold war crates loot crate

shit like that in the war crate you get

some Oryx loot crate you get some loot

and they cost real world money but the

money can also be earned in-game now I

already know what you're thinking but

Charlie I poop with both cheeks spread

this is a single-player game how could

loot crate's be that big of a deal

well the issue here is while the game

can be played just fine without them

towards the end of the game you have

this absolutely absurd just downright

preposterous grind to get the true

ending that is really sped up if you get

the loot crate's obviously but it almost

seems encouraged to get the loot crate's

because who's gonna spend 50 hours doing

the exact same shit over and over again

to get the true ending and 40 to 50

hours is what most outlets are reporting

on I didn't get the true ending myself

because I don't want to support that

kind of business model where it seems

like a loot crate is the only viable

option other than just sitting down and

treating this like a nine to five job

and playing at every fucking day so I I

will say now I didn't get the true

ending but I can go watch the true

ending on YouTube for free and I think

that's a much better deal than

supporting some shit like this but the

point I'm making is it seems like they

stretch

out this grind for no reason other than

to make people throw their arms up fuck

it I guess I'll spend $20.00 to speed

this up because I want to see how this

ends I want the closure and that's a

horrible business practice now

admittedly I've spent more on less I've

wasted money before as we all have I

mean one time I spent $100 on a fucking

brass pocket trumpet I had no clue how

to play still don't know how to play but

it was on sale and it just it seemed

like I was losing money not buying it

but at least that money helps support

somebody or some practice that isn't

inherently evil like this lootcrate

system is Warner Brothers throws us in

here just for that easy quick cash

because loot crate's are the new thing

in this this gaming world loot crate's

are in everything it's just this form of

gambling it's addictive it seems like

it's the best way to make money in the

video game industry and it's a horrible

practice and does nothing but hinder

games that it's in and it's in pretty

much everything now that that's out of

the way let's talk about the actual game

which is pretty damn good the story is

easily the weakest part of this title

it's just very predictable it's not very

interesting there's a whole lot of

exposition a lot of dialogue but all of

it is so incredibly stiff and cliche

what do you mean nazgul you're betraying

me I can't believe it oh I didn't see

that coming it's just everything is very

uninteresting the story is just not good

it's it's pretty damn weak characters

are nice though I actually thought the

characters were good and a pretty bad

story I was surprised that I actually

liked a few of these characters when I

say a few characters I don't even mean

the main story characters in fact I

really didn't care for any of those I

mean the orcs the orcs have a lot of

personality a bruise the chopper is my

favorite character in the game the orcs

are just so fucking great they blow the

main stiff characters out of the water

they're brilliant the orcs steal the

show in terms of likability and in terms

of they seem alive whereas all the other

characters just feel like fucking

marionettes its orcs are fantastic the

game doesn't look very good though the

game looks like an Xbox 360 launch title

everything is just kind of ugly

there's just weird filter on it that

just makes it seem like there's this

very thin film of ass crust over the

game I played this on ultra and it still

just didn't look good the animations are

clunky as well but now where the game

really shines is the gameplay and

there's fantastic nemesis system and

they have so much depth to the orcs and

killing orcs and manipulating them in

building our army it's just so great so

let's go ahead and start talking about

that the gameplay is just like the

Arkham series it's not quite as good but

it's still very well put together and

it's very fun to play killing orcs

doesn't really get old until you get

towards the end where you've done the

same thing a million times and it does

start to overstay its welcome because

they put in that fucking ridiculous

grind but be up until that point there's

just no getting burnt out on it because

it's always a very interesting fight

always a lot going on you'll get swarmed

by all these orcs you still have to

start jerking them off in all directions

then you get your little captain out

there you break his spirit you if you

look at his deepest darkest fears if you

gather Intel from the worms that kind of

you know spill the beans let the cat out

of the bag so that way they tell you the

weakness and you can start to scare them

with spiders or if they're afraid of

fire you can light them on fire it's

just so fucking great there's so much

depth there's so much to learn about the

combat and I loved everything about the

combat the orc system here I don't even

know what to really call it the Nemesis

system it goes a little beyond nemesis

though you can have you know them send

death threats to some leaders then the

leaders will start to hunker down and be

stronger and the loot increases there's

so much to talk about with gameplay and

I really can't talk about all of it and

I can't gush enough about it

gameplay here was fucking amazing and

really really fun and new and definitely

my favorite part with the gameplay is

when you do finally build up enough of

your orc army so you can storm the

fortress and challenge the Overlord with

all of his war chiefs it's chaos pure

pandemonium and it's fucking great and

the music really complimented the fights

to make them seem really climactic and

great another thing that was good was

the settings there was a lot of changing

settings each region was vastly

different from the previous one which

was nice they may not have looked

visually all that great but I do

appreciate the settings not just being

cookie cutter although they all kind of

function the same they didn't look the

same and they weren't laid out the same

another really good thing that I liked

is traversing the map was very easy

because you could just sprint around and

climb anything you could go one side of

the map to the other in two minutes of

just straight running and climbing there

was

nothing you couldn't climb in this game

it was like the Skyrim horses but on

purpose you could climb a 90 degree flat

surface just covered in butter and baby

oil and it was no problem for Talia and

he would just immediately climb that

shit up so you never had to worry about

trying to get get around something or

trying to find like some kind of secret

entrance through it you could always

just climb over it and go from there

which was nice there was nothing really

tedious about the travel now let's go

ahead and pop this shit into the moist

meter here this is a 70% the game is

really good

the gameplay is great putting everything

aside from the lootcrate system

everything left is fun stories weak the

multiplayer I didn't really touch on

because it's kind of just bare-bones but

it's not bad it's fun you can you know

make your own fortress people online can

storm that fortress and you can storm

fortresses you know shit like that it's

fun it's not a huge part of the game but

it is enjoyable definitely something

worth getting if you're a fan of the

free flow style combat that Arkham

series is kind of made popular and if

you're just a fan of hack and slash

games in general there's a lot of depth

to this one a lot of different ways to

approach fights and there's a lot of

fights so yeah that's a so yeah

Moist Meter: Blade Runner 2049

initiating moisture good morning and

welcome to the moist meter I just woke

up and I know it looks like I've been

fucking zapped by static shock but I

just had a whole lot on my mind so

instead of Saturday morning cartoons

which are no longer a thing now we have

Friday morning cartons have come

delivered right from moist meter

headquarters

I hope you've worked up an appetite this

breakfast morning because we're

delivering a highly nutritious cereal

breakfast consisting of all the major

groups and the food pyramid high in

vitamin W vitamin what of course and

we're gonna deliver a moisture content

analysis at the new movie Blade Runner

2049 going into this movie I had very

low expectations super used to just

swallowing shit that the ass goblins and

Holly would shovel out there unnecessary

sequels to great movies remakes a great

movies all of which just suck anus but

this movie got really good reviews

before coming out so I actually got some

pretty high hopes going into it and

leaving the theater I was really

indifferent there's so much I liked but

there was so much I didn't like let me

start with what I liked the visuals are

the best I've ever seen any movie the

world is absolutely beautiful the film

is shot perfectly it is the most

beautiful world I've ever seen the movie

I wanted to just live in that world I

wanted to crawl up into its dick hole

and just exist in it it was absolutely

breathtaking every scene so much eye

candy gave me I diabetes the world is

just shit my pants and slapped my mother

beautiful and what really helps take

that to the next level really elevated

above what human beings can comprehend

even the most high IQ Rick and Morty

viewer will have a hard time

comprehending the beauty and the

magnitude of these amazing visuals is

the sound it complements it so well the

sound is just incredible so great it's

really loud though makes it feel like

you're in a fucking roller coaster ride

or getting hit by an earthquake the

whole movie theater shakes at some

points but it's so great and it all fits

the mood and makes the whole world feel

alive it's the sound design and the

music is the best I've ever heard in a

movie ever so this movie has the best

visuals I've ever seen in the best sound

design I have ever heard it the sound

just always builds up like it's just

this crescendo where it keeps building

up building up building I'm trying to

get you hyped up like like you're really

horny and you're trying to ejaculate you

got your bender

strokes and then it lets you ejaculate

with a great visual piece and a great

musical climax the sound the visuals

perfection genuine perfection nothing

shy of a masterpiece but everything else

in this movie sucks anus like it really

just gargles farts out of assholes like

this story is just so uninteresting so

cliche I had a dream last night where I

was the limo driver for Robocop and he

had to go stop Judge Dredd so I was

driving him there and I was trying to

help him strategize how he would do such

a thing and that dream had a more

interesting plot than this movie this

movie is just so devoid of substance

it's not thought-provoking it very

loosely explores the idea of what it

means to have a soul but it ends up just

kind of exploring the idea of what it

means to put people to sleep because the

story fucking sucks it's just not good

and the things that happen kind of

happen and no one cares because there's

no purpose to it there's no resolution

in this movie when the credits do

finally roll after three fucking hours

nothing changes really everything that

happened was so insignificant nothing at

all in that world or in the movie at all

had any impact on anything it was just

so fucking useless it was like a like a

Dora the Explorer adventure where she'll

go on this adventure the adventure ends

and then you know who cares it's just

dumb it was really dumb and I want to

touch on the runtime of this movie it's

about three hours this movie drags on

like a motherfucker there was a scene

where Kay the main character was picking

up a toy horse for three minutes

it took him three minutes to pick up the

toy horse because he was moving so

slowly that's half of this movie half of

this movie just drags on in the most

unnecessary departments it'll be a

minute or two minutes of him just

looking intensely or smoking a cigarette

I get to finish I get to watch and

finish a cigarette and then light

another one it's just dumb and so much

as movie drags on it has no reason to

drag on it doesn't build suspense it

doesn't make you feel anything there's

just really nothing interesting about

the plot at all at all and don't go in

there expecting action the trailers make

it seem like it's pretty heavy on action

there's four scenes of action if you can

even call it that everything is

underwhelming there nothing in this

movie really feels important at all all

the final fight is so dumb

I mean you might as well had the final

fight on a bumper car Rena arena stupid

it was just so so underwhelming I think

it's the best word for it underwhelming

story underwhelming action underwhelming

development there's a little plot twist

that you can't really predict and it

doesn't really matter but who cares this

is this such a letdown they had so much

potential here to tell a really great

story but they didn't use it at all the

story is truly just uninteresting they

also really hyped the fuck out of

Harrison Ford being in this this was

like McGregor vs. Mayweather except this

would be McGregor and Mayweather holding

hands in an action movie that's how the

trailers made it seem but Harrison Ford

doesn't come in until the last 30

minutes of the movie and 20 of those

minutes is spent as a damsel in distress

he just gets kidnapped immediately and

chained like a fucking animal in a cage

for 20 minutes and has to be rescued and

then the movie ends it's dumb

he had he had no role I mean he had a

role his character played a role in this

really mediocre story but Harrison Ford

himself didn't do fuck all in this movie

there's really not a whole lot more need

to put my dick in here so let's go ahead

and just put this on the moist meter

analysis machine this is a 75% and it

hurts me to say that because I want to

give this something like a 95 percent

because this movie is fucking stunning

in every department except the plot and

really anything revolving the plot it's

just so uninteresting and I get what

they're going for they're going for a

character that a lot of people can

relate to a character who's very lonely

no one likes him and the only way has

any type of companionship or a friend is

through a machine that is designed to be

his friend and tell him what he wants to

hear a holographic Furby that is always

on his team and it's sad he's a sad

character he has a little bit of depth

but so so what he doesn't nothing he

does really takes advantage of this

great world of this villain they set up

he just kind of exists as a lonely man

who wants to be special has an

opportunity to be special and tries to

work on that aspect on being special

trying to fulfill that special calling

that he might have and it's just not

it's not interesting it's it's not

compelling it just it really doesn't

take advantage of everything this movie

could have brought it's a it's just a

letdown that

that's the best word for it it's a

letdown everything is great except for

that still we're seeing because it's

fucking beautiful hopefully you have an

entire data set aside because this shit

is so incredibly long but yeah it's a

good movie and that's a yeah

Moist Meter: Cuphead

initiating moisture moist meter cup had

two words that are synonymous with

excellence many of you would probably

like me and remember cup hat being first

announced when you were a young boy now

you're a 23 year old man who's graduated

college and has sprouted a very scraggly

beard that he hasn't shaved in a while

and you kind of expected cup had to

never come out but to everyone's

pleasant surprise that has finally been

released into the real corporeal world

and my god is it amazing it is a

beautiful great beautiful excellent

great splendid experience let's go ahead

and start with the beautiful great stuff

let's start with the best thing the

first thing that's gonna give everyone a

stiff clitoris and a hard wiener is the

aesthetic of this game the visual style

designed to be like a hanna-barbera

cartoon it is absolutely amazing it is

just a joy to watch joy to play

everything is just so nice to look at it

is just an absolutely gorgeous looking

game it ejaculates style it anally leaks

perfection just the visuals are so nice

and stimulating it is it's great my

favorite visuals in all of video gaming

most likely I'd really have to think of

something that can even compete with

this I had a really rough hangover just

a matter of hours ago but when I sat

down and played cuphead for a little bit

it not only completely got rid of the

hangover but it filled my body with

great nutrition and vitamins it made me

a taller and more handsome man and not

only is the visual style top-notch I'm

happy to say it's not like one of those

games where it has really great visuals

but everything else is lackluster

because I spent all the focus on the

gist the look of the game and everything

else kind of sucks ass here everything

is really great not just the visuals the

gameplay is super fun and it's very

challenging it's really trying to push

our species to evolve and adapt it's

kind of like the scene in Deadpool where

they're forcing the mutations to come

forth that's what cuphead is trying to

do to our species and it's beautiful the

game is challenging but it's fair it's

very fun to play soundtrack is it's

really nice it's gives you something to

really wiggle your finger to

[Music]

it's just a great and fun soundtrack the

coop is nice it's not fully realized

it's just kind of a bare-bones style

co-op which is fine because it's a nice

thing to just kick back and play with a

friend that's nearby there's a story

here that's obviously not the focal

point and it doesn't really play a huge

role in anything the game really

revolves just around the bosses and just

general gameplay but the story it really

isn't bad it's pretty interesting and it

makes you want to figure out how these

two cups are actually gonna beat the

devil very embarrassing for the devil to

even be threatened by two cups some

household objects but these shits don't

fuck around there's also a lot of

gameplay a lot of content here for a

price tag of twenty dollars there's a

lot in this game there for that price

point now there is a few complaints I

have about the game and I also need to

mention I'm only showing footage from

the first couple of bosses because a lot

of the fun of the game comes from

finding these new bosses and being

shocked by how beautiful they are makes

you want to give them a big sloppy kiss

so I'm not gonna spoil any bosses any

more bosses than just the first couple

now the complaints I have is the bosses

rely a lot on trial and error there's

your never gonna one cycle a boss for

the first time you're gonna take many

tries to do it it's not exactly a huge

complaint because it'd be underwhelming

to just steamroll a new boss so it's

good that you can't really do that but

it does get frustrating because you have

to commit at least 15 deaths to each

boss just even figure out what kind of

pattern is going on and how are you even

gonna take them down and sometimes the

bosses can just rely on bad rng like the

clown rollercoaster amusement park

thrill-seeker guy that boss kind of did

boiled down to you just got to make sure

the roller-coaster is in a good mood

but really it's it's fun the trial and

error is fun and it makes it challenging

which is good the another thing that's

really kind of lacking is everything

that's not a boss battle the running

guns sections they don't really seem

very fleshed out they're very just not

that interesting is it they're there to

collect coins

they're there to just

kind of keep you horny for the upcoming

boss battles and the coins help you get

new power-ups to fight the bosses

they're just not super great they're

still fun but they're not nearly as good

as the boss battles and they're just

kind of stale overall that's about the

only real complaints that I have the

game is just absolutely fantastic so

let's go ahead and put it in the moist

meter I'm giving this a 90 percent that

is the highest so far on the moist

meters history so a big round of

applause and a solid high-five the cup

had and the team the game was absolutely

worth the wait and it's worth the $20

it's a game I think anyone will enjoy

even you're not a fan of old school kind

of games the old like Megaman style or

anything I still think this is a game

most people would enjoy it's just really

really fun and it's beautiful so that's

it so yeah

Moist Meter: American Made

[Music]

[Music]

initiating moisture today the experts

here at wild wetness incorporated data

analysis group trademarked will analyze

the moisture content of the new Tom

Cruise flick barry sierra american-made

he plays Barry seal so I'm not too far

off let's go ahead and start with the

story I'm a big fan of history I didn't

know too much about the whole Barry seal

SOG I must have missed that ARCT in the

manga but it was very interesting I

thought this story was pretty well put

together it was a very interesting story

after looking up a lot of the real Barry

seal shit a lot of the movie was to make

just fuckin make-believe which isn't bad

because I think the story itself is a

shrouded in so much mystery so many of

the files are still classified to this

day so I mean he's really not a whole

lot you can do with it besides just kind

of take some liberties and I think they

did a good job telling a very

interesting story for the most part

however one of my biggest complaints is

the editing especially in the first half

of the movie is just very chaotic and

doesn't really explain things very well

one second Barry's getting beat to shit

in a Colombian prison next second the

CIA's bailed him out and he's delivering

guns on behalf of Uncle Sam it doesn't

really fill in these blanks on why they

would bail him out and why they needed

him in the first place it's like if I

wanted to distribute meth throughout

Tampa and I looked up the world's best

Girl Scout cookie cellar and had her

distribute it for me just kind of odd

and somehow things just keep jumping and

getting more and more extreme for Barry

one second he's struggling to make money

the next second he's got so much money

he's using it his toilet paper and he's

hiding it in fucking McDonald's bags

across town and then a next second after

he's been caught and everyone knows what

he's done he's meeting the President and

he's going to

here oh he's like the fucking Forrest

Gump here it's just incredible the

amount of shit that he gets into and I

know it's loosely based on a true story

but I can't help but question how much

of it is even closely related to what

really happened that's not a complaint

or anything I'm not going there to get a

fucking history lesson I'm not going

there for class I was going there to be

entertained and I was it was a good

movie another thing I really liked was

the cartel they made the cartel seem

like just a genuine group of nice frat

boys I wanted to pop open a cold one

with them they weren't scary Pablo

Escobar was a bro everyone was cool in

the cartel makes me want to get into it

obviously I wouldn't last very long in

it but that shit definitely seemed fun

in this movie now let's get to some

complaints I have the camera work at

some points of this movie makes no sense

it just gets really shaky for no reason

it's like some Cloverfield shit going on

when they're just hanging out in an

airport I don't understand why I guess

the camera operator was really cold they

wouldn't give him a nice jacket or

anything and he was freezing so he

started shivering made the camera work

kind of nauseating at points also I hope

you like Tom Cruise's smile because

that's half of the shots of him in this

movie is just his fucking ass eating

smile on the screen not really a bad

thing I mean I guess that's just kind of

the character he portrays but man it's

excessive there's also a couple other

things I could nitpick but I'm not going

to let's go ahead and get to the moist

meter calculations here this is a 68%

now I know I only do like intervals of

five because those are the only ones

that mean something but I feel like I

need a little bit of an arbitrary number

here to convey that it is a good movie

and it's better than I expected it to be

I give a lot of 65 percent so I think I

want to take it a little step forward

and go for a 68 but it's not quite a

seven you don't I mean it's a good movie

decent story

don't go there expecting a whole lot of

action or a whole lot of titties and

stuff just go there expecting a fun

decent story about the cartel and a man

who gets in a very lucky and very

complicated situation soundtrack I I'm

sure there was music in here I didn't I

didn't make note of it and like I said I

don't really keep track of that acting

was good Tom Cruise always is a very

consistently decent actor so yeah

decent movie probably worth seeing

that's a so yeah

Moist Meter: Kingsman The Golden Circle

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter it's time for the moist meter

talent show I can play the intro to the

fast and furious Tokyo Drift song

teriyaki boys on my coconut instrument

ready

[Music]

among my musical talent I am also an

elite moisture content analyst and today

on the chopping block is Kingsman the

Golden Circle

now the first Kingsman is one of my

favorite movies ever created I think

it's just an absolutely outstanding

movie so I was very excited to see the

second one now let's pop pussies let's

talk about the most important part of

Kingsman what people are expecting from

the Golden Circle and that's the

over-the-top outrageous cartoonishly

violent video game style action that the

first one was known for and I'm happy to

say the Kingsmen Golden Circle has that

it's the same spirit everything that you

would expect from a new Kingsman movie

is here in terms of action everyone

remembers the church scene from the

first Kingsman men still masturbate

imagining that scene to this day even

people who haven't seen the Kingsmen

movie have seen the church scene it's a

classic scene unfortunately there's

nothing really comparable in Kingsman

the Golden Circle but the action is

still miles ahead of any other modern

action movie where all of them they're

filmed in a way where any time some

action happens they flush the fucking

camera down a toilet here the action is

all in your face you can tell what's

going on and it's super fun to watch and

I don't like comparing the sequels to

their predecessors I like to review

movies as kind of a standalone

experience but for Kingsman I think it's

kind of important to at least touch on

what the original and second one have in

common because most people seeing the

second one our fans are the first and

they want to know is it kind of like the

first does it have what made the first

one so special and for the most part it

does in terms of action the story is

lackluster it's it's more the same from

the first it's to save the world

situation but with the less interesting

villain Valentine is my favorite villain

in all of movies so it was never you

never going to top him for a sequel but

they did a pretty commendable job with

Poppy but really she's the only

interesting new character aside from

Elton John Elton John fucking killed it

in this movie that's an oscar-winning

performance really from Elton John here

but other than those two everyone else

was a super lackluster especially

Channing Tatum

they hyped the shit out of them in the

trailers but in this movie he doesn't do

fucking anything he's like The Suicide

Squad Slipknot but in Kingsman just

absolutely useless in all areas he

doesn't even say fuck yeah like he does

in the trailer he doesn't do anything

neither does Jeff Bridges nobody a lot

of this movie just felt like a lot of

wasted potential and just laziness all

around they just rode off some beloved

characters in the most underwhelming

ways up what happened to super important

Kingsman number four I fell down some

stairs

what about turbo Jimmy Neutron Kingsman

I stepped on a landmine

it's just shit like that very

underwhelming they could have at least

had them go out in an interesting way

it's just it was let down there but one

thing that I really really liked about

this movie is fans of the first one are

gonna get a lot of special treats in the

second one here they pay homage to the

first one a lot even entire scenes like

for instance the manners maketh the man

scene they play on that expectation in

here and they hype that shit up in the

in the theater the whole audience myself

included started going nuts when that

scene started to play but the kind of

toy with you a little bit and change it

up and it's it's really nice there's a

lot of scenes just like that and they do

a lot of shit like that

and I loved it I thought it was very

self-aware just great all around and I

don't have a whole lot of complaints

other than just story and character

issues the main things that you would

want to be great about this movie are

great it's just that it's just a lot of

little stuff that they didn't do very

well action was great it felt a little

long story dragged on characters weren't

interesting but everything else from the

first one translated to the second one

and it was very fun to watch so let's go

ahead and pop this bitch into the

clipboard that also doubles as a

top-secret experimental moisture content

analyzing device and suit we did

it's a seventy-five percent the movie is

great in all areas where you'd want it

to be the action the style and the main

characters from the first one especially

Harry they're all super badass and it's

great to watch them do their shit here

it's just it really drops the Zippo

lighter that doubles as a nuclear

football in the story and

new characters aspects the new

characters aren't really cool except for

Pedro Pascal playing whiskey

he was really fucking cool but everyone

else just got a lame and not fleshed out

or fun to watch they don't do anything

cool either but you know if you're a fan

of the first one you'll love this one

and I think it is a very good movie in

and of its own right if you haven't seen

the first one you'll probably still like

this one for all the action and yeah

that's it see ya

Moist Meter: Mother!

initiating moisture I can't even give a

proper intro to this moist meter I have

just so much on my mind about the new

mother movie that I want to get it out

there as soon as possible so mother's

the new movie with Jennifer Lawrence and

Javier Bardem or bodman fucking Dennis

Rodman javier can't remember his last

name I'm blanking on it but you know who

I'm talking about Javier

everyone knows Javier he's a big actor

and this is the movie that you've seen

previews for that markets itself as a

horror movie it's not a horror movie it

doesn't try to be it's not even close

this is a very pretentious

artsy avant-garde type of movie now when

we saw this movie like wow that was one

hell of a crash so yeah I don't have a

camera or anything I just taped my phone

against this wall sometimes it falls

that was just more of a sign that even

the universe doesn't even want me

talking about this movie because it's

really not even worth the breath it has

a very clever concept very poor

execution when my girlfriend and I saw

this movie we were counting the minutes

till it was over it made no sense this

whole movie is just an hour of pure

uninteresting boredom the last 30 to 40

minutes is just a cacophony of screams

yelling and gunfire nothing makes sense

it's a confusing rabbit rectum of a

movie it's just so unfunny to watch it's

not till the very end that you can kind

of understand what this movie was really

about and what it was going for and I'll

get to that in a second but when we saw

this movie six people left one of them

even shouted that this movie was awful

any regrets wasting his money on it like

what more you do I have to say about it

that's how everyone in the theater felt

that's how we felt too and then at the

very very end you get this clue as to

what this whole movie was really about

and if you really think about it in a

very abstract way you can connect the

dots but for the most part watching this

movie is like looking through a fucking

kaleidoscope during a tornado after

popping 12 tabs of acid it makes about

as much sense as two Big Macs in a

washing machine

why are there two Big Macs in your

washing machine what are you using him

some type of fucking detergent no it

doesn't make sense and that's what this

movie is like now I'm gonna do something

I haven't done on the moist meter before

I'm going to say what this movie is

about because everyone's raving about

this movie at least all the film buffs

that love to smell their own farts and

when I get to the moisture percentage

found in this movie I don't want them to

have that excuse if he just didn't get

it this cro-magnon couldn't understand

this beautiful piece of art no I get

what this movie was trying to do it just

doesn't do a good job it's not

entertaining to watch the messages

aren't clearly conveyed and I'm not

saying they have to be but there's just

no real connections to be making here

unless you really really really stop and

think about this in a very abstract way

now it's not fun to watch it all is my

biggest complaint about what they're

trying to do here it's just not

entertaining in essence this movie boils

down to God the earth and humanity

Xavier plays God Jennifer Lawrence plays

the earth the house represents the earth

so Jennifer Lawrence is more like the

mother of the earth and then everyone

else in this movie is us humans and in

essence what happens in this movie

starts with one stranger Adam eventually

his wife comes representing Eve then

eventually some more strangers coming in

two brothers one brother kills the other

representing Cain and Abel from there it

just snowballs into just pure

pandemonium and just downright awful

stuff there's at the end there's just

war cults just overpopulation eventually

leading to mother earth killing off the

planet and then Dodds Xavier starting

anew the mother blows up the house thus

getting rid of the earth and Xavier just

starts again that's that's kind of just

a whole message of this movie humans are

killing earth it's just telling the

story of the Bible and it's filled to

the brim with symbolism just beat you to

death with symbolism and it's just not

entertaining it's not fun and you're not

gonna pick up on this shit either unless

you watch the whole movie and then think

back on it and just very odd ways I had

to look up some shit to I can I can

admit that I'm not embarrassed to say I

had to look up a few things to make sure

that I'm on the right track and it's

just it shouldn't be a difficult to

figure out what you were watching and

even still once you figure it out it

doesn't make it entertaining that didn't

make the movie any better to me at least

put it into into some logical sense and

things kind of add it up but that

doesn't make it make it fun doesn't make

it worth seeing I love the concept I

loved what they wanted to do here but

they just did it so poorly so bad

watching this movie was just a chore it

was painful really another thing that

made this movie incredibly painful to

sit

was the camera work every scene had a

close-up of Jennifer Lawrence's face

just following it around anytime there

was any type of muscular spasm if she

had an itch on her face you bet your

bottom dollar you bet your sweet ass

hole that we are zooming in on that

little muscle spasm we're looking at

that itch under a microscope here with

the camera it is just nauseating how

many close-ups of Jennifer Lawrence's

face we have throughout this movie

that's at least half of the footage at

least there's really nothing else I want

to talk about here there's no reason to

because this just boils down to the

movie not being a fun movie to watch

even if you figure out what's going on

and what it's saying from the get-go if

you can somehow Sherlock Holmes super

sleuth your way and to really comfort

comprehending what this movie is telling

you if you have one of those epiphany

moments in every CSI or detective show

on TV where you pick up on some

miniscule detail out of nowhere all

staircases heaven God wait a minute and

you can figure this out right away that

doesn't make the movie any better you

can understand this movie from the

fucking first second and this movie is

still just not fun to watch it's boring

it's a very boring and uninteresting

movie but it has a great concept and I

respect that but it's so poorly used and

utilized so let's go ahead and see how

much moisture is in this motherfucker of

a movie this is a thirty percent to me

and it's a thirty percent because I

absolutely loved what they wanted to do

here what the creative vision here was I

loved it I loved what they wanted to do

the idea is great but it is just not

entertaining at all just so poorly done

and it's a shame it really is because

it's a really clever idea it's a really

smart movie with its ideas but it just

couldn't make it a fun movie to watch

and that's just unfortunate but it's not

worth seeing I don't think it's worth

seeing under any circumstances even

knowing what it's about going into it

there's just nothing of value here

nothing fun about it just a waste of

time really but yeah I mean that's it so

yeah

Moist Meter: Destiny 2

initiating moisture prove yourself

worthy and I will brand you a means to

true

[Applause]

growing up I was groomed to be the

world's most accurate moisture measuring

analyst on the planet it was my destiny

to measure moisture content in all forms

of media a gift bestowed upon me by the

gods and anime now I'm using that gift

to measure the moisture content of

destiny - I held off on reviewing this

I've played a lot of destiny - but I

wanted to wait for the raid to come out

to review it in order to give it a very

proper and thorough sprinkle of gumdrops

here for an accurate moist meter on it

so let's go ahead and start first thing

I want to get out of the way this game

is exactly like the first destiny UI is

pretty much the same the game plays the

same if you've played destiny when

you've played the gameplay for destiny -

I'm not saying that is a bad thing I'm

not saying it is a great thing when it

comes to first-person shooters there's

not a whole lot you can do to innovate

if you have a successful formula it's

best to just kind of keep that formula

and build upon it in my opinion I don't

think they really built upon it very

much

everything is just way too similar they

could have done some different stuff

with the classes instead of just slight

tweaks in a little different shit but

that's just a personal opinion if you

like destiny ones gameplay you'll like

destinies - gameplay the big difference

between destiny 2 and destiny 1 is they

actually tried to tell a story here in

the first 30 minutes of destiny -

there's more exposition than the

entirety of destiny 1 in the first game

trying to find a story or lore in that

universe was akin to trying to find the

toenail clipping in a sensory

deprivation tank that's a football

fields length but here there's a story

there's a purpose there's a reason to be

doing things that you're doing now I

don't think the story is that great I

think it's pretty poorly told I think

it's even laughable in some parts

there's still a lot more questions

without answers a lot of things are

still mysterious I think the universe is

great but the story itself is just kind

of lame the main characters are decent

they're not bad they're not flushed out

or anything nor do they try to be

they're decently written they have their

own little personalities

it doesn't make them stand out or be

memorable you won't think back on

destiny - and remember any of the

characters in any positive way if you

even remember them at all you won't

think tears no fucks of all it was cool

that dr. Manhattan looking motherfucker

was just a great character can't wait to

dresses him for Halloween the voice

actors for these characters probably

won't even remember these roles but then

the story has never been the big draw

for the destiny franchise it'd be an

added bonus if they flushed out their

universe and really put their best foot

forward for it but that's not what milks

the dicks for these games it's all about

the gunplay diluting the cool-looking

shit that's what it's about destiny to

has that the gunplay is fun the weapons

look badass at least some of them a

couple of them look like they're just

made out of fucking paper in a

third-grade classroom but for the most

part the metal weapons look great they

feel great to shoot the gunplay is crisp

responsive the abilities I think are

very lackluster a lot of the abilities

are just exactly the same they do the

same amount of damage have pretty much

the same utility it's just the

difference between the abilities is that

like the same difference between a

multigrain cheerio and a regular cheerio

you can't taste the fucking difference

but there is a slight difference it's

just kind of a letdown that these

abilities aren't cooler aren't more

unique but one thing about this game

that is unique is the visual style

everything is just drop-dead gorgeous

absolutely splooge material beautiful

everything is draw george is looking at

look at this it's jaw it's drop it Jesus

I can't say jaw-dropping holy shit the

beauty of the game has taken the ability

for me to say jaw dropping away from me

it is just a really good looking game

that's the point I'm trying to fucking

make everything looks really really nice

and another thing that really stood out

was the music the soundtrack in this

game was very lovely beautiful stuff I

was very very surprised that the

soundtrack wasn't just the generic dumb

stupid sci-fi shit that you're used to

hearing a thousand times over let's move

on to the next big talking point here

the raid the new raid that just dropped

everyone's talking about it you can't go

to a supermarket without them talking

about the new goddamn destiny to raid is

it good yeah it's pretty good for the

most part except for one piece of shit

unnecessary abominable abortion

of game design it is the second big room

in the raid where you have to sneak past

dogs it's called pleasure-garden and

there is no pleasure to be had at all it

is miserable

it is a stealth section in this game

that just doesn't work because the AI

isn't responsive enough it's broken

it just doesn't function the way it

should it is the most unfun experience

I've had in a first-person shooter in a

very very long time

it is a sandwich where the bread is

nails and the inside of the bread is

cockroaches

it is painful it is incredibly boring

there is not an iota of fun to be had in

this pleasure garden segment of this

raid it is so bad I just can't even

fathom the thought process I can't wait

for their next expansion where one of

the raids will have a fucking trivial

room on the fucking daily routine of

some of the designers that'll be fun

that'll be a really fun room except you

can't look up the answers anywhere and

it's not multiple choice you just kind

of have to guess fill in the blank can't

wait for that room bungee this room just

makes no sense in the context of this

game

there is no reason the pleasure-garden

room should exist in the form that it

does it's so bad it is so incredibly bad

I can't find enough words for it but

apart from that the raid is fun it looks

nice of course it's challenging but a

fun kind of challenging and it's very

different and I liked it except for that

fucking pleasure-garden room I don't

think there's a single person out there

that can defend the pleasure-garden room

it had to just been a joke at Bungie hey

let's fuck with our players here by

putting this stupid room in here they'll

love it and if they don't we'll love it

now let's move on let's let's let's wrap

this all up here what is the moisture

content here what is the moisture

percentage it is a 70% moisture this

game does a lot of things right there

was a lot of things they fix from the

first game into this one there was a lot

of things they've kind of tweaked a

little bit but I don't think there was

enough differentiation between the first

game and the second game to really wow

anyone

it just was pretty much the same

experience you were used to in the first

game coming here the second one now I

don't usually like to compare sequels to

the predecessors but for this one it's

really hard not to since this game is

marketed to the people who played the

first one most people who are interested

in destiny

or the people who played destiny one

it's not really targeted for a new

audience to come into this and it

doesn't try to either and that's not a

bad thing not at all it's just I don't

think it was very different this could

have been just a big destiny 1.5 here

it's not a full-blown new experience

they tried a couple different things

with the story and stuff and I

appreciate the effort the story wasn't

super great though but there's just a

lot more they could have done to really

improve the experience but as it stands

right now there's a lot of content here

a lot of time you'll be putting into the

game it's a very crine d game so if

you're not a big fan of grinding it out

for power levels and shit probably not a

game you'd enjoy but it's beautiful the

gun plays fun it's a great first-person

shooter for the most part there's just a

lot of things that could have been

better and the raid it could have been a

whole lot better without that second

fucking room the pleasure-garden fuck

that room but yeah that's it

so yeah

Moist Meter: IT

initiating moisture welcome to the moist

meter where the thing we fear most is

dryness today we have the it movie to

review and measure the moisture content

of so I'm gonna get this out of the way

right now I'm not a big fan of Stephen

King

I think he's overrated I think Ginga

Swan is the superior writer and

visionary that being said the new it

movie it was the shit it was really good

it really took me by surprise I was

expecting it to be decent but this was

actually good so I'm gonna start by

undressing this lady and playing with

her nipples the things I liked here I'm

gonna get them all out of the way on a

nice list this story this story was

fucking fantastic it actually made the

horror movie trope that's just been beat

to death and overused like a fleshlight

at a frat party makes sense where the

bad thing is just scaring people for the

sake of scaring people with no real

reason well in this movie the scaring of

the the main characters makes sense

because they have to be afraid in order

for them to be vulnerable for the bad

thing to kill them now when I say killed

I mean fucking annihilated and it shows

every single detail in there and the

main characters are kids so you don't

expect them to get all bloodied up and

gory like they just got hit by a fucking

Mortal Kombat fatality but this movie

shows you all of that it doesn't shy

away it doesn't pull any punches it

shows you them getting brutalized by the

bad guys here and I'm not saying I want

to see kids getting all fucked up like

they just stepped on an AED or ate a

pipe bomb but for this movie it really

adds a whole lot to the overall

experience because you know the

characters aren't safe at any moment you

could see some fucked up shit happen to

them and I think that adds a lot to the

overall horror aspect of this movie the

scariness the creepiness shit like that

it's the next thing I want to talk about

this movie doesn't follow the same

formulaic pattern as most horror movies

these days most horror movies are so

cookie cutter you can predict every

single thing this movie you can't it

tried to do a lot of different things

and it did it pretty well

there was some genuinely creepy moments

it did have quite a bit of jump scares

but I thought they were used pretty well

not you know the usual shit we're just

super loud noises like a fucking

umbrella opening at the camera and you

feel silly for being startled by it

don't be that there were a couple of

goofy ones in there that made me

my eyes but I liked mostly what they did

for creepy and scary mnestheus

but I didn't like all of it I thought a

lot of it fell very flat for example

they had a little zombie bad guy in

there and he was just kind of goofy and

felt a little out of place and then per

usual it unfortunately fell into the

same trap as most horror movies where at

the very end where they're confronting

the main bad thing it goes on so long it

just stops being a scary bad thing it's

at its best when it's building the

suspense up to the scary bad thing that

you only get little glimpses of here and

there or only for a short period of time

when you have a long drawn-out battle

and dialogue between the characters and

the bad thing it takes away from the bad

thing as a whole it makes it a whole lot

less scary albeit the characters had

some great lines there it just takes

away from it being scary and just kind

of turns into more of like an action

movie struggle type deal but I mean

everything else leading up to that was

just great they did everything else

great and you know I don't know how else

they would have ended it other than that

that's more of just a personal pet peeve

of mine where you have this frightening

being that you've hyped up allmovie I'll

eat your nose I'll blow your bros just

something super scary and then at the

end you have this showdown where it's

just a conversation between the two of

them like a fucking student talking to a

teacher after class about extra credit

really just kind of takes away from it

being that super scary thing the writing

was fantastic characters were fucking

great all of them really all of them are

super well-written you start to like

every single character for the most part

there's some weaker characters here in

there but the main cast is super great

Pennywise the clown fucking nailed it

bill scaz guard or Asgard or fucking

Thor Valhalla whatever his last name is

bill you did a great job with penny wise

if you're watching this bill you fucking

killed it in that role and you're

welcome to come on the official podcast

soundtrack was pretty good it's nothing

super memorable but I don't really

always care too much about soundtrack if

it stands out to me that's a huge plus

but if I don't really care too much

about it if it's just kind of in the

background of everything who cares I

don't go there for the soundtrack it's

not like I'm listening they're looking

for boner jams or anything if it fits

the movie I'm happy it didn't stand out

to me as bad so that's good let's go

ahead and flush this down the moist

meeting toilet

it's an 80% I go into horror movies with

the lowest possible expectations usually

thinking I'm just

- laughs during the movies but this

movie really stood out to me it was an

actual good horror movie it's not

perfect characters still do stupid shit

like in every other horror movie but in

terms of horror movies where all of them

are just pretty much ass balls of movies

just absolutely thrilled to watch this

one was enjoyable from start to finish

and it has to say something it was good

it was actually creepy unlike a lot of

horror movies it didn't rely on the

crutch of jump-scares it would show you

some scary things and it's just

everything that tried to do it did

pretty damn well and I definitely think

it's worth seeing so that's it so yeah

Moist Meter: Death Note Netflix

initiating moisture they say the Lord

has blessed us with only two true gifts

for Humanity minecraft and anime now

when it comes to anime there's one that

many celebrate and it's called Death

Note then a couple days ago

Netflix released their own version of

Death Note and it's nothing like the

anime at all it doesn't even try to be

so let's just get this out of the way

now I'm not going to compare this to the

anime if you haven't seen the anime you

should and if you have then just know

this has almost nothing to do with it at

all

the only similarities they have are the

book exists and so does Ryu that's about

it I'm gonna review it as its own

standalone thing and even on its own

standalone thing this shit's not that

great the story is the ass cheeks and

everything else is the whole the main

character lights a very generic

character bullied high school kid and he

wants revenge and he has a strong sense

of justice he falls in love with a

cheerleader who smiled at him one time

and she falls in love with him because

she asked about one of the students

getting decapitated to which light than

shows her that he can kill people with

this book so he kills somebody in front

of her and then that of course sparks a

flame in this relationship as it would

for most relationships I mean these days

how hell is he gonna get a relationship

you can't always just buy a runescape

girlfriend because they're pretty high

in demand as well so sometimes you have

to take it to the next logical step

which is kill somebody for a girl the

movie tries to be kind of shockingly

gory or whatever but it doesn't really

come across that well the the gore is

pretty nonsensical it makes it seem like

every human being in this movie is just

a fucking pile of meat on top of itself

waiting to just fall over because every

time someone's even slapped their head

comes flying off there reminds me of the

old over-the-top gory action movies with

a low budget from like the 80s and 90s

like Riccio which isn't necessarily a

bad thing I can at least respect them

trying to do something kind of

different than what people would expect

from deathnote and that I can respect it

didn't really come over very well but at

least respect where their head was at

for it what I can't respect and what I

have even less respect for than an open

bag of potato chips in a dumpster is the

characters in this movie they were just

fucking bad the only one that I even

kind of liked was Ryu and I think that's

just because Willem Dafoe was cool in

the character and they at least made Ryu

kind of this mysterious sinister guy

lights uninteresting and a really hard

character to root for like it all it's

just he acts like a 12-year old Don

player unknowns battleground oh but this

is bad I give up no I shouldn't give up

yet pipi is very small but my peepee

might get bigger oh but this is good but

it's bad it's just back and forth flip

flops whiny not a very smart character

with the notebook until the very end of

the movie he doesn't do anything really

intelligent until the very end me is

just stupid and she's just a dumb

character in here out of the main

characters I'd say L was at least not

the worst so I mean he's the best out of

the three which isn't a big compliment

to make but he at least tries and kind

of does some interesting stuff almost

but yeah the characters fucking blow and

the pacing of this movie is horrible

it's like they tried to fit so much into

this short movie that they ended up

putting nothing into it and it's nothing

but filler and one scene light finds the

notebook in the next scene he's already

executed the Canadian rowing team it's

just a lot of shit that's left out

somehow L tracks him down to Seattle by

tipping him off on some Japanese drama

or some shit huh I've got Akira White

right where I want him I told him my

mother was having an affair and now my

mother has been executed by Kira that

tells me he's in Seattle I knew it from

the get-go it's just it's leaving out so

much detail and it's hard to follow why

things are happening and how we're

getting from place to place here please

go ahead and slap this into the moist

meter content analyzer I'm giving this a

25% it's pretty bad it's it's definitely

not good but I can say with confidence

if you haven't seen the anime or read

the manga then you will be a lot more

forgiving of the problems most people

are having with this movie right now

and if you have seen the anime or read

the manga then this is nothing like it

this is unrecognizable from the source

material this is to Death Note what

Terminator is to the Titanic it's just

not even close but imagining this movie

is its own standalone thing with nothing

to do with any previously existing

material it's it's not very good yeah

it's still just bad it's kind of one of

those so bad it can be enjoyable movies

and for that it might be worth watching

if you're a fan of bad movies like I am

but yeah it's not great that's it yeah

Moist Meter: Birth of the Dragon

initiating moisture it's the moist meter

where we analyze moisture content of a

movie and put it on a scale the more

moist the better I just saw a birth of

the dragon don't mean to spoil it

there's no moisture here it's fucking

abysmal sucks the farts out of a dirty

asshole this movie spits on the legacy

of Bruce Lee now growing up all I

watched was kung fu movies really the

amount of VH tapes my parents imported

for me so I could watch more kung fu

movies is fucking astounding I once saw

a Star Wars parody kung-fu Chinese movie

no idea what it was I'll never find it

again I don't think the actors remember

that making that movie but I saw that

shit and I won't forget it but anyway

Bruce Lee was like a superhero to me no

more than that he was like a mythical

creature like the fucking tooth fairy

I'd leave notes under my pillow asking

me if he'd teach me wing Jun Bruce Lee

meant a lot to me so this movie which

advertises itself is kind of a biopic of

Bruce Lee and telling of the legend

where he fights Wong Jack man it's

misleading to say the least

the only truth in this movie is Bruce

Lee did actually fight Wong Jack man in

private that is a fact but this movie is

not about that it's not even about Bruce

Lee

it's about this one made-up fucking

character named Steve McKee the most

useless character in any movie I've ever

seen in my entire life Steve McKee is

just a stalker in this movie that's his

role he does that and whine constantly

and does absolutely nothing else but for

some reason he is the catalyst for this

entire movie and this entire movie runs

through Steve Mackey for no fucking

reason I don't know why you would make

the movie centered around the legend of

Bruce Lee and Wong Jack man and for some

reason just taking you know some fucking

irrelevant nobody that didn't even exist

the time oh let's just go ahead and

let's take the janitor who accidentally

cleaned up a toenail clipping from Bruce

Lee and let's make him the star of this

show

it's so fucking stupid to me and Steve

McKee is the worst character I've ever

seen in a movie the story is as follows

Bruce Lee he teaches Steve McKee is one

of his pupils Steve McKee also has a job

during the job he meets a Chinese woman

she speaks English which surprises Steve

McKee

and immediately he falls in love once he

hears she speaks English she's in a bad

situation to get her out of that bad

situation

he makes Wong Jack man fight Bruce Lee

and somehow that freezer I don't know

how you can make birth of the dragon

hype it up as all about Bruce Lee and

celebrating Bruce Lee but he's not even

the main character in fact he is the

villain in this movie they portray Bruce

Lee as an insufferable douchebag just an

absolute pile of shit I don't get it I

don't understand it's just an absolute

disgrace it's deplorable now the best

thing I can say about this movie is the

casting choice for Bruce Lee and Wong

Jack man is fantastic it's just a shame

they were given such an absolute fart

balloon of a script and cow rectum for

fight choreography to work with because

with those two playing those characters

this could have been amazing now the

next thing the fighting is so

underwhelming and absolutely horrible if

you're a fan of kung fu movies you'll

hate the action if you're a fan of

movies you'll hate the action I just

don't get how it could be so

unentertaining it's as if they took the

best parts of kung fu movies and

fighting in general and replace it with

amateurish moves you'd expect

eight-year-olds to be performing on the

front lawn of their house in their

neighborhood it's so bad half of the

audience in the theater I went to see

this visual vasectomy of a movie what

are laughing during the action scenes

that's how shitty they were and the

dialogue was so corny I couldn't help

but laugh sometimes the plot was just so

incomprehensibly poorly edited and

poorly explained and made no sense the

characters fucking sucked every single

time there was a fight scene for some

reason they constantly just stopped the

action and just zoom in on each other's

eyes it's nothing made sense it fucking

sucked this movie is an abominable ass

blast trash stack colon cleansing dick

punching urethral swab of a movie to sit

through

it's just absolutely insulting let's go

ahead and put this on the moist meter

here I'm giving this a five percent the

only reason I even give it any

percentage is because the casting was so

fucking perfect for it long Jack man and

Bruce Lee but man that just made it even

more disappointing just how bad it was

because you could just imagine what it

could have been if it wasn't what it is

so bad it's horrendous I can't even find

enough words to express how bad this

movie was holy shit and what makes this

diarrhea popsicle of a movie even worse

is I go online to see if I'm the only

one that hated it this much and I find

that 82% of Google users like this movie

you let me fucked up Google users please

defend this movie I'd love to see anyone

defend this movie I mean I guess if

you've never seen a movie in your entire

life then yeah I guess this might be

something we're seeing but for anyone

who's seen a movie please explain what

there is to like about this defense

Steve McKee I swear to god it's

impossible you could take a brand-new

human being an infant fresh out of the

womb of fresh toddler and you can make

them watch this movie their first words

would be fuck Steve McKee what's the

point what's the point of that character

they will go on a rant about the

uselessness of that character I feel

human beings are hard-wired in their DNA

to not like Steve McKee's character it

is absolutely atrocious just a horrible

character an awful character this movie

fucking sucks

so yeah

Moist Meter: Annabelle Creation

initiating moisture I hope you're

clinching your ass cheeks together as

hard as you can so you don't let the

demons go up your asshole because today

on the moist meter we've got a horror

movie for you called Annabel creation

well I mean we don't have it for you we

didn't make the fucking movie but we saw

the movie so let's just dive right in as

is the case with every modern horror

movie you have the dumbest characters

doing the dumbest shit imaginable I

guess in this movie it's a little more

excusable since the main characters are

children but even still I find it so

hard to believe that these little girls

have testicles of tungsten where they're

going to be confronted by demons and

shit not even scream the girls don't

make a single fuckin noise throughout

most of the movie when they're being

haunted by the Annabelle doll demon it's

just amazing to me they don't even get

help they don't talk about it in one

scene one of the little girls on the top

bunk and then in the bottom bunk she

sees the Annabelle doll and a demon pull

it away and then she just falls asleep

with that underneath her and the bed

shaking just falls asleep I don't get it

the little girls just have the

short-term memory-loss where something

evil will happen they'll get past it and

forget it ever happened they just want

to go out for ice cream or some shit it

just doesn't make any sense to me I just

don't understand why no one can make a

horror movie where the characters aren't

fucking dumb but greasy stinky brain

dumb dumb characters aside the movie is

pretty decent the story's pretty cliche

but it's effective it's not trying to

reinvent the condom just your old

Haunted doll flick and it follows the

same formula as every other horror movie

where the evil thing just kind of toys

around and scares with the people just

to give itself a good old belly laugh

until like the last 30 minutes of the

movie where every spooky thing just all

happens at once into pure fucking chaos

and the movies pretty heavy on jump

scares and you can pretty much predict

every single one of them that's going to

come because it uses music the same way

as every other horror movie does it'll

start to gradually cut out music till

it's silent and then whoa yeah that's a

jump scare get you good I guess so I

mean you're not really going to be

caught by surprise at anything in this

movie however I will commend the

director here there were some pretty

creepy scenarios you

are some pretty different approaches to

making things Irie and I can respect

that another thing I really respect

about this movie is there's a whole

bunch of tie-in to other horror movies

in the Blum House universe it's like

Blum house is trying to assemble their

own Avengers of horror movies which i

think is really cool the acting in this

movie was fine no complaints there every

character seemed like you know they are

in peril or you know scared and shit no

complaints about the acting

the sound design your standard horror

movie shit it's basically just horror

movie starter kit for sound design and

just your standard hard nipples on

chalkboard shit like that

the writing was also pretty cliche

nothing really stand out it's there but

no complaints either really just the

whole movie did what you'd expect and

want from a modern horror movie so let's

go ahead and pop this into the moist

meter I'm clocking this at a 60% the

movie is good and for horror movie fans

definitely worth seeing but you're going

to know what to expect every step of the

way

it just doesn't try and do too many

things different the only thing it

really plays with us different scare

setups and different scare scenes but I

mean you still have the dumb characters

the standard writing standard soundtrack

standard story really it's just it does

what you'd expect it to do but it does

it pretty well it's just I wish horror

movies would start to move past the same

things we've seen hundreds of times but

Annabelle creation does what you'd

expect and does it pretty well that's it

Moist Meter: Transformers 5

initiating moisture moist meter it's

what you're watching transformers the

last night what you shouldn't watch

let's just dive right in the last three

transforming movies have been absolutely

abysmal Revenge of the Fallen

dark of the Moon age of extinction all

just rectal flap casserole of movies

genuinely boring genuinely uninteresting

no fun to be had make no sense not

enjoyable to watch how is the last night

pretty much the same as those I will

concede that Anthony Hopkins fucking

kills it I really like his role and I

also like this sidekick cogman I thought

those are the only two redeeming

features of this movie but I'm also just

a big Anthony Hopkins fan but despite

his good performance you didn't really

carry the movie or anything now I don't

go in here expecting a great storyline

or any type of character development

it's a Michael Bay movie you go in there

and you expect shit to blow up and some

robots to smash heads and put dicks

together and make a bigger robot you

expect some transforming and that's kind

of what you get here except it's very

boring for the most part just like the

last four movies not like I said I know

coming here sporting a full tuxedos

sniffing my own farts with a notepad out

expecting some Academy award-winning

shit but yet I came in here with low

expectations and was still extremely

disappointed by this I hold the

transformer series in the air and dear

to my heart

loved all of it growing up loved the

first movie I even loved Beast Wars if

anyone remembers that which is kind of a

transformer spin-off I actually liked

that a lot

but these movies are just not good at

what they're aiming to do give you some

mindless fun it's just not fun it's so

boring and it's always the same shit

with these movies this movie's big draw

was don't you want to know what I keep

coming to earth bitch the last three

movies explain that to me what's going

to be this time huh is it because of our

advanced envelope adhesives you can't

find it anywhere else in the universe

it's just so stupid and then here it was

some big catastrophic event that's never

been done before with Cybertron coming

to earth whereas another movie had the

exact same plotline with bringing

Cybertron to earth it's fucking dumb

suspend your disbelief all you want but

if you've seen the previous Transformers

movie you're going to get to this movie

like us shit been there done that this

is just one giant fuck bucket of a movie

there's no fun to be had here no cool

action scenes that make

this worth seeing nothing it's just so

boring and somehow every time there's a

little scuffle neither the Autobots nor

Decepticons can fucking hit anything

every single shot misses and just hits

behind them or in front of them are next

to them to the sides it's like watching

a blind man try and come shot a moving

target optimus prime goes evil for about

five minutes before he decides to stop

being evil Megatron's on screen for

about ten minutes before he just gets

fucking obliterated he's just a

laughably bad villain he's like the Box

goes from Danny Phantom of the

transformers universe he just serves to

just get fucking beat every single time

and do nothing

the final battle with the main

antagonist is extremely underwhelming

and unsatisfying the entire fight is

over in about one minute with one single

torpedo blast it's like a fucking Nerf

dart just hit her and she explodes this

is everything about this movie was

underwhelming and not good soundtrack

mediocre at best

it's not great it's not horrible sound

effects horrible it just sounds like

someone listening to dubstep and

smacking two wrenches together every

time there's a fight I've already talked

about how awful the storyline is and I

was only just getting started but

there's no reason to make this a 15

minute moist meter just criticizing how

bad the story was action lackluster

never cool never satisfying hard to make

out what's going on and a lot of the

action scenes except you know for a fact

every single fucking shot misses because

it lands behind them and they do like a

Power Rangers gymnastics move trying to

sell it with little sparks flying out

let's just go ahead and plug this into

the moist meter now I'm giving this a

25% the only reason it's that high is

because Anthony Hopkins and cogman were

cool characters and I enjoyed them on

the screen also Mark Wahlberg's

character I think is a cool character

and that's about it those are the only

two redeeming qualities about this movie

that I saw everything else about this

movie is a bottle of butthole it's

really not worth seeing even if you're a

huge fan of transformers I don't think

you'll enjoy it I don't really know who

the movie is aimed at either because

it's not exactly suitable for little

kids because a lot of parents are very

uneasy when it comes to bad language and

there's a lot of shits bitches and asses

thrown around in here and there's a lot

of other like mature elements to it I

guess but it's also very childish

there's dinosaurs and then there's some

Knights that transform into a fucking

dragon

so I truly don't think they know what

target demographic they're going for but

regardless it's a jumbled fucking mess

of a movie that's not very fun to watch

and just kind of a waste of time that's

it so yeah

Moist Meter: The Mummy 2017

initiating moisture mmm reviews it's in

the moisture and today we're going to be

analyzing the moisture content of the

new The Mummy movie the new mummy movie

stars Brendan Fraser making his return

to the limelight and it is a spectacular

hit that's what I want to say but that

wasn't the case the new mummy movie

doesn't have the legendary actor Brendan

Fraser in it nor is it a spectacular hit

movie also is in a massive failure like

I was expecting which is a nice surprise

I thought Tom Cruise did a really decent

job in this movie however it just

doesn't feel like a mummy movie it's

missing a key ingredient it's missing

Brendan fucking Fraser the Fraser laser

is nowhere to be seen

you can't eraser the Fraser and expect

it to still be a mummy movie it just

doesn't work it's like trying to make a

corn bread casserole without the corn

the bread or a fucking kitchen this

movie just doesn't feel like a mummy

movie

it also doesn't feel like a movie worth

seeing or a movie worthy of

jump-starting the dark universe for

Universal Studios I'm going to go ahead

and add that the dark universe is the

worst fucking name you could have given

this that's like an xbox live gamertag

for a 13 year old they may as well just

titled it xx shadow shadow xx just

laughably bad Universal you've got to do

better than that it's just embarrassing

dark universe what cro-magnon thought

that was a cool name I'll go ahead and

get off this rant though so the mummy

movie it's not horrible the plot is an

incoherent mess though it doesn't know

what story it's trying to tell it

doesn't know what tone it wants to go

for to just throw so much shit at you

and it makes no sense Russell Crowe's

character Jekyll and Hyde don't mean to

spoil it but I don't think any of you

really care that much is kind of a cool

character I guess if he wasn't just

haphazardly fucking rim job then to this

movie he probably could have been pretty

cool as could the whole organisation

that captures monsters but everything is

just so ham sandwiched in here that it

just doesn't matter and you can't follow

along nor do you really care I will say

the first 2025 minutes of this movie was

really good it's exactly what I would

have wanted from a new mummy movie it

actually felt like an

nice new modern mummy movie and then

it's all downhill from there it tries to

get too serious and it doesn't work at

all because they don't know how to get

serious and make it interesting but for

that first 20 to 25 minutes I was

sailing at full mast I had a nice big ol

direction because this reminded me so

much of my favorite movies the mummy and

the mummy returned but man once that

25-minute marks you can just pinpoint

the second the writers lost track of

what they're trying to do they forgot

what assignment they were given in

school here started writing like a side

quest for an MMO it was just horrible

it just completely lost track of where

it wanted to go and what it wanted to be

and really just overall the movie lacks

focus and then they didn't even know how

to end it the ending was abysmal I

thought the last 40 minutes of the movie

were just unbearably bad with such an

anti climactic ending the final fight

between the main character and the main

villain lasts about as long as I do in

Marvel vs. Capcom 3 online so all of

about 15 to 30 seconds it really wasn't

even a fight or a showdown It was as if

they went to an arm-wrestling

competition and then just talked out

their differences it was just less of a

fight and more of a conflict of

interests that wasn't fun to watch and

it wasn't a good way to wrap up the

movie but everything leading up to it

was shitty - the movie was basically

just zombies that's that this was more

of a zombie movie than a mummy movie and

it tries to be kind of like a horror

hybrid type of movie but it's not scary

at all it goes for some cheap jump

scares that don't work and it just

forgets that the mummy

the first two mummies revolved around

just a fun action-adventure movie this

movie had fun for about the first 20 to

25 minutes and then was just boring and

uninteresting and been there done that

it just wasn't interesting there there's

a lot wrong with the movie is that we're

seeing maybe it's just kind of your

standard little zombie action flick

there's nothing too special about it I

wouldn't go there expecting an actual

mummy movie or anything even close to it

to be honest but there was a lot of

potential here if the movie had kept the

same tempo in the same tone that the

first 20 to 25 minutes can

it probably would have turned out to be

a pretty damn good movie there's just a

lot of wasted potential for this film

soundtrack who gives a shit you're

coming to see The Mummy movie you're not

expecting to hear a great score you're

not going to hear some hans zimmer

masterpieces or anything like that it

got the job done I didn't notice

anything fucking bad about it I didn't

hear any recorders or people banging on

trashcan lids it sounded like music

decent music that you would find in a

movie now if all that said let's put it

on the moist meter I'm going to clock

this what about a 50% I'm going to call

it an average movie because it is an

average movie as an action zombie flick

there's nothing wrong with it but it's

not a mummy movie don't expect it to be

but I was entertained throughout the

film which is why I'm giving it that 50%

it wasn't super duper dry nor was it

super duper what it was kind of as if a

mummy was dunked in a pool you know the

dryness was in the wetness the wetness

being the mummy franchise because those

are my favourite franchise The Mummy and

The Mummy Returns those are my two

favorite movies ever and then they took

the dryness with Tom Cruise and

cannonballed it into the Brendan Fraser

zone wetness now I'm going to go ahead

and clarify I don't count Tomb of the

Dragon Emperor a mummy movie that's just

a fucking shit stain on an otherwise

flawless franchise so I guess the best

compliment I can give the new mummy

movie is it slightly better than Tomb of

the Dragon Emperor alright that's it see

ya

Moist Meter: Wonder Woman

initiating moisture you know a time it

is its moist meter time bitches the

wettest around if you were lost now

you're found welcome to moist meter

headquarters ladies and gentlemen today

I saw a Wonder Woman and it was good and

it doesn't matter what I think of it

because you're going to see it

regardless we all know that but it's my

duty as a professional moisture content

analyst to analyze this movie thoroughly

and put it on our patented moist meter

so the battle between Marvel and DC

movies hasn't exactly been a battle it's

been more of a fucking slaughter because

DC's movies have been just absolute

dogshit just blowing rectal flaps

especially Suicide Squad - most people

DC stands for don't care because no one

gives a shit about their superhero

movies because now they know that

they're not very good however I'm happy

to say they've turned it around with

Wonder Woman and it was actually pretty

fantastic if you've seen a superhero

movie at any point in your life over the

last 25 years then you should know what

to expect out of Wonder Woman and it

does what you expected to do and it does

it very well there's no need for me to

get into the nitty-gritty titty here I

don't need a urethral swab every aspect

of this film it was just an overall good

film the action was surprisingly unique

every single fight scene was pretty

fuckin badass

I wasn't like a Transformers movie or

modern action movie where there's a

whole bunch of cuts and shit and you

can't really tell what's going on or in

the Transformers case just looks like

two fucking coke cans slamming against

each other now that don't mistake this

there's a ton of cuts during the action

but for the most part it's not too

disorienting and you can still make out

what's going on and apart from the

action the character development I

thought was really well executed you

started to care about the characters and

it was fun to watch them get along with

each other

watching Wonder Woman adapt to the

modern world it was enjoyable it wasn't

cheesy and it wasn't forced it felt

pretty damn nice to watch the acting was

fine I never really critique acting too

hard unless it's awesome buttered butt

cheeks because he's an absolute ass

cheeks of an actor and he makes me upset

when I see him in movies and I wonder if

he can do it why can't I

the man's a fucking plank when it comes

to being on screen but I'm going to go

ahead and in that rant right there

acting was fine

there was no glaring issues or

not acting anywhere this story was a

cliche superhero one I have no problems

with it dad guys got a big bad weapon I

could destroy the world gotta stop him

so Wonder Woman in the team they get

together and they take it down that's

yeah I don't mean to spoil it but you

know that's just kind of how it works

but the movie doesn't shy away from

getting pretty dark

there's no real twists and turns or

anything but the movie does get very

dark with some innocent people getting

killed some war horror and just it's

pretty dark and that's kind of the vibe

DC's been going for with their DC movies

there's nothing wrong with that I like

the gritty vibe I think it can fit DC

comic book movies really well however

it's been poorly executed up until now

and another thing DC has been gargling

smegma with up until now is memorable

music in no DC movie before this one was

there any song or tune that you would

immediately associate with a DC

character unlike Marvel Marvel where

there's a bunch of themes that you

associate with those characters this one

they actually had a pretty decent score

for Wonder Woman she had her own little

nice beam I mean overall the movie was

just solid it didn't do anything

extraordinary or something incredibly

amazing but it was a very enjoyable

experience and by far the best DC movie

that's been made yet that's a definite

plus for me because I've always been a

big fan of the DC Comics and I would

love if their movies weren't just a

pitiful joke in the movie industry so

let's go ahead and slap this on the

moist meter I'm clocking this at an 80%

like I said it's a very enjoyable movie

it's a good movie DC's best by far and I

really don't have anything bad to say

about the movie so I know people in the

comments going to say that why isn't a

hundred percent moisture why hasn't it

reached the bose-einstein condensate for

moisture on the moist meter and a

hundred percent

well just because I can't complain about

anything doesn't mean this movie did

anything extraordinary or game-changing

it's not going to be a movie that I'm

going to remember every scene ten years

from now it's not going to be a movie

I'm going to show my kids that it must

see or anything but it was a very good

superhero movie it did exactly what you

expected it to do and it did it well but

it's nothing that's going to be a

fucking time capsule piece that we're

going to want to show aliens as a

representation for our creativity but

yeah it's a good movie 80% on the moist

meter it should also clarify that the

Dark Knight

trilogy is not part of the DC Cinematic

Universe

so those three films aren't taken into

consideration when looking at DC's

movies too

Moist Meter: Alien Covenant

initiating moisture welcome to moist

meter let's dive right in

I saw alien covenant I've got a lot to

say I'm a huge fan of the alien series

and even prometheus despite all the

shortcomings there was a lot of problems

with that movie and I'm happy to say

that Ridley Scott has taken all that

criticism from Prometheus and wiped his

asshole with it he has taken all of it

thrown it in the garbage and said fuck

you every problem that existed in

prometheus exists in Alien Covenant the

main problem I have with this movie in

the same problem I had with Prometheus

the same problem everyone had with

Prometheus the scientists don't act like

scientists they're fucking stupid they

act like high school students going to a

log cabin for a vacation in the very

first scene of this movie where they

enter the foreign world without the

first scene but in the beginning the

movie where they go into a foreign world

they don't even dress in spacesuits or

anything they're dressed like they're

going on a weekend fishing trip a strip

club has a more strict dress code than

what these scientists wore to a world

they didn't even know they didn't scan

it or anything they just assumed since

it was like Earth it'd be totally fine

and just an alien fucking planet Anne

didn't even cross their mind to wear a

helmet at least and let me just say this

entire movie everything that went wrong

could have been avoided if they had worn

a helmet nothing else I could want a

helmet and fucking swim trunks and this

movie wouldn't have happened because the

main problem here is one person gets

their ear infected with the pathogen for

the Xenomorphs and another person gets

their nose infected with it that could

have been easily avoided with a helmet

something that should be pretty standard

procedure for some advanced elite

scientists you know something even a

fucking 4th grader would think of so the

two people they infected with the

pathogen you know obviously they died

and it leads to a lot of problems they

lose the escape vessel all this type of

shit they meet David you know the same

it's just a whole cascade of bad shit

that happens just because they couldn't

put on a fucking helmet another thing

that I think would be common-sense for

scientists is to not just touch

everything mindlessly these people

literally can't stop touching shit they

touch everything one of the people that

gets infected with pathogen touches this

foreign fungus that just goes right up

his nose and then he just goes about his

day like nothing's wrong now there

person touches a fucking giant testicle

pot holding the face hugger and then

unsurprisingly gets attacked by the face

hugger why do they have to touch

everything they're like fish attracted

to the shiny lure except these aren't

even shiny or even that interesting

there's no reason to be touching half of

this shit they just touch the gnarliest

and grossest looking shit with their

bare fucking hands I don't get it it'd

be like looking at dog shit on the side

of the road pulling your car over just

so you could poke it I'm not going to

keep raining about how stupid the

characters are but just know that is the

entire reason this movie even happened

is because the scientists couldn't act

like scientists or even anyone with

common sense they just acted like

fucking zombies it's it's hard to

understand why Ridley Scott can't write

some competent characters but anyway I

will say that the story was interesting

I've always been a really big fan of the

overarching plot I find it to be a

really fascinating concept and this

movie's major saving grace is Michael

Fassbender he is just absolutely

spectacular he plays two roles he

returns as David and also plays a new

synthetic named Walter and it's just he

doesn't absolutely outstanding job with

both characters and I truly believe

David is probably one of my favorite

movie antagonists of the last 10 years

at least I really just like him as a

villain I also of course really liked

the settings and the way everything

looks in the movie it all looks really

breathtaking the Goron shit's really

convincing and disturbing it's just it's

a Ridley Scott movie you know you get

what you expect you get gore you get

pretty settings you get pretty looking

shit so I have no complaints in those

departments and I also thought the

acting was really good I thought all the

actors and actresses did an outstanding

job playing their brainless vacuum

cleaners now there's one scene in

particular I want to point out not in

regards to the good acting or anything

just a scene I think needs to be talked

about especially for me I consider

myself a recording connoisseur a

virtuoso of the recorder and the

recorder actually plays a role in this

movie it actually comes in and makes it

fucking triple a big-budget movie debut

which is finally it deserves it's just

good to see it in the movie a movie and

it's a really weird scene though David

Whittle the recorder out of wood Walter

finds it and wants to learn how to play

it so David starts to teach him

and it's this really oddly romantic

scene and it's kind of strange since

it's both played by phosp in der so this

is just a strange thing there and the

scene went on for so long it was like an

actual full-length recorder lesson for

the entire audience I wanted to start

taking notes so that way I could learn

this shit when I got home for my

recorder but anyway back to big points

the last 2530 minutes of this movie are

just great and the ending is spectacular

a really really solid ending that I

think fans of the series will really

appreciate however if you haven't seen

any of the Alien movies before this

especially Prometheus if you haven't

seen Prometheus you're going to be lost

in this movie it doesn't do a good job

of bringing new viewers in you have to

be familiar with the story in order to

really get the most out of this

otherwise it just doesn't really make

too much sense now let's take all this

shit into consideration and slap this

bitch on the moist meter this is about a

60% to make the story is really just

fascinating I love the themes of

creation and I really like the way they

weave all that into the core ideas of

the movie however it's just really hard

to excuse some of the decisions the

characters make and just suspend this

disbelief that these scientists are this

fucking stupid and that all of this

could have been avoided if they just

followed common sense but putting all

that aside the movie is very pretty to

look at at times disturbing when

characters are getting killed off the

gore is just very visceral it's also

just a really interesting story that I

think even though you may not know

what's going on if you haven't seen

Prometheus you'll still find yourself

very interested in and just overall it

has a lot to offer it's intense there's

a lot of action a lot going on and then

it leads to a great ending to the movie

so yeah that's it so yeah

[Music]

Moist Meter: Little Nightmares

initiating moisture you've just tuned

into the moist meter I'm here to ask and

answer two simple questions how moist is

little nightmares and how erect is my

wiener the second one's easier it's semi

jump the first one I'm going to have to

get a little in depth with as per usual

I'm going to go ahead and start with the

story

this game has a fantastic story

it was surprisingly interesting to learn

more about six and also the world that

they're in where this game is taking

place the mall figuring out its true

purpose and also the way they don't just

feed you the story they kind of tell it

in a really interesting manner and it's

just fun to just learn about everything

going on here it's also very dark tale

it's no Magic Treehouse miss

Frizzle is not going to come out here

and pat you on the ass cheeks until it's

all sunshine and smegma this is a very

thought-provoking and just very grim

tale to be told now let's move on to the

visual style the visual style is

beautiful the environment is absolutely

stunning as are the characters and the

camera really helps complement all of

this the camera is not really static it

actually feels like it's a part of the

in-game world it'll pan in or pan out

also rock with the ocean too and it

really helps give this cinematic feel to

the game and the characters just look

amazing there's a butcher who looks like

 Jabba the Hutt if he wanted to

pursue a career in mediocre culinary

arts he's like a fungal abomination of a

distorted human being everything in this

game just looks so eerie and unnatural

in a good sense it really gives out this

very strange and creepy feeling for the

whole game which is just great now the

core gameplay here is some very light

puzzle solving mechanics as well as also

doing some platforming and since the

game is in 2.5 D the platforming can

just be absolutely infuriating a lot of

times the environment will just betray

you you'll think you're safely on a

Ledge but then you'll just make one

wrong move and fall off and then the

painfully long loading times make it

just an incredibly frustrating

experience that's the biggest complaint

I have here I can't count the number of

times I would fall off of the ledge

you're off of the map just because I

transitioned from run room for the other

and then I wasn't on the middle of the

platform anymore and I couldn't adjust

because I couldn't tell that I was no

longer in the middle so I just run right

off the edge I was like a bull

chasing the red towel just right to my

demise and that was just incredibly

frustrating and it also happened with

jumps you can never really quite tell

how close you are to the edge or how

close to something seen oftentimes miss

the jump and then the load times are

just brutal and I heard there's a

trade-off where the load times are

brutal because it lets you load the

entire map in one go so there's no

loading in between rooms which I guess

makes sense but it still makes for a

really long down time where you just sit

there and fester in your frustration for

 up and a lot of times it won't

be your fault because of the way the

environment deceptively tricks you into

just falling off now when it comes down

to the real meat and muffins of this

game it boils down to a hide-and-seek

type of game you see the boss enemy in

front of you and you need to finagle

your way to the other side of the room

to escape or you need to sneak around or

just figure out their pattern so you

don't get caught and get instantly

annihilated because this game is pretty

much all instant death you don't really

have a lot of different tries you can't

just pee your pants when you're caught

and they'll just drop you or anything

like that or you lubricate your way out

of their hands through urine if you're

caught that's game over and then you

have your forty second load time

to wait through and you can just sit

about what you've done but it's really

nice I really like this it makes for

some very creepy situations it'll make

for some very tense situations because

you're trying to avoid them or figuring

out how to get away and it's really

really cool I really enjoyed the

hide-and-seek mechanics here and I think

it was just fantastic now popping all of

this information and my super computer

and running some advanced algorithms I

was able to calculate that this game

comes out to about an eighty percent

moisture content it's a really great

game it's a very short game though it's

about four to five hours depending on

how well you get through it and solve

the puzzles and figuring out how to get

through some of the obstacles but it is

really worth the price tag I'm of the

belief that a game doesn't have to be

long to be worth the money it just has

to be memorable and fun and this game is

both memorable and fun the only reason I

didn't put it a little higher is because

the amount of times that the environment

would betray me and just have me fall

off the map because I couldn't quite

tell

where I was on it was just incredibly

frustrating and that coupled with the

long load times plus some really unfair

obstacles that were just kind of trial

and error you wouldn't ever be able to

know some of the instant-death

obstacles that awaited you were there

unless you had already died from them

and I just think that's a pretty poor

gameplay design but overall this game is

just spectacular it's truly a splendid

experience one that's surely gonna

sprinkle sugar on your salt shakers it's

just great and I really enjoyed it and I

actually really liked that it wasn't

longer it didn't overstay its welcome I

think it was just long enough to tell a

really fascinating story and really make

you think as well as just have you

enjoyed the time with it where nothing

really got stale and repetitive they

kept it nice and fresh got to see a lot

of different things do a lot of

different things and overall just a

great game that's it

so yeah

Moist Meter: Outlast 2

initiating moisture there's a lot of

scary shit in the world but I think we

can all agree the scariest thing this

world has to offer is dryness that's why

the moist meter goes where no one should

ever go we play the dry shit that no one

should ever play and we put it on a

moist meter so that way you know just

how moist it is today's game outlast -

it's a horror game now I know me saying

a horror game makes you immediately roll

your eyes because those games are a dime

a dozen but this game is a little

different for most horror games this

game is the sequel to another game

called outlast this is the second entry

into the series I want to start with the

story because that's something that

really surprised me and stood out to me

I'm a big fan of games and movies that

will go for a darker vibe of something

realistic not just monsters and demons

the main focus of this one is some

lunatic Christians that are just fucking

rabid animals basically as well as

dealing with the supernatural a little

bit which is fine but I really like

exploring that mentality of someone

who's so obsessed with something that it

just drives them to lunacy the story of

the game is as follows your Blake

Langerman and your wife Lynn Langerman

is missing after a helicopter crash you

two were involved in I'm going to go

ahead and address the elephant in the

asshole here Lynn Langerman is a

horrible name that's a really bad name

it's a horrible combination it's like a

peanut butter and bleach sandwich the

two just don't go together very well but

anyways you're trying to find your wife

and while doing so you uncover a pretty

deep and interesting plot you're also

having flashbacks of fourth grade and a

girl you knew back then I really really

enjoyed the story I'm just going to say

I thought it was fantastic all around

the voice acting was really really good

the characters were really well-written

everything was well-written and the

story was just fucking interesting you

just wanted to understand how all the

pieces connected and what was going on

here now as far as the graphics and

visual style goes everything looked

pretty fucking good especially the

environment the environment really

popped everything just felt real the

bloodied mangled corpses all of it

looked really convincing and disturbing

the only thing I will say though is a

lot of just the regular

characters that hunt you are pretty

goofy and not very intimidating or scary

they're just kind of laughably odd

they look like school bus drivers that

just had a bad day and just found this

Culp and just decided to tag along just

to fit in he'll say some goofy shit do

like on the eyes of God I'm but a simple

farmer stroking his girth each owed but

the Lord spoke to me and said even the

lympus tough dicks can shoot some come

and then I'll stab you with a knife it's

just it's not scary you're eerie it's

just kind of weird and pathetic and you

kind of feel bad for those characters

it's like you're a strange neighbor that

stands in front of his window and a

half-open bathrobe every Sunday or some

shit like that but apart from just a

normal average Joe villager hunting you

down all the other characters look good

and what's really good about this game

is it doesn't shy away from just being

incredibly brutal it shows you every gut

curdling visceral detail behind some

absolutely horrendous acts which is good

that a horror game wasn't afraid to be

disturbing to look at at points that's a

very good thing that's a positive now

what I'm going to say next is probably

going to squeeze a lot of people's

nipples pretty hard so just giving you a

fair warning horror games to me aren't

scary horror games only scare people who

want to be scared by them but that

doesn't mean I don't like the genre in

fact I really do like the John I just

think it's oversaturated with a lot of

mediocre and uninspired horror games

this isn't one of them but I'm just

pressing the gameplay portion I'm going

to talk about here with this statement

the gameplay does not really do a great

job of making you scared of getting

caught it just makes it more frustrating

than anything like damn they got me

gonna have to do this again it's never

really scary when you're caught however

the gameplay does a good job of building

up tension because you'll have to wait

for some of the characters in the

environment to move around so that way

you can sneak by them and you'll have to

do a lot of stealthy shit in order to

get by them you're not going to really

be able to brute-force your way through

on your first playthrough when you don't

know what you're doing a lesson I

learned the hard way because I'm a

hardcore impatient gamer barbarian

sometimes so in this game I had to take

my foot off the pedal and dial down the

testosterone a bit and take a step back

and slow it all down which is really a

good thing because it puts you in this

perspective of a journalist who is not

prone to fighting he's not someone that

can put ass to faces when it comes to

fisticuffs so it does add a

not to the immersion of the game and the

tension building because you can't fight

back so you have to make sure you're not

caught now this is the biggest

shortcoming of outlast 2 is everything

is a chase sequence for the most part

and you're always just looking for a

hole in a fence or a branch to crawl

under and nothing really evolves from

that nothing really changes the chase

sequences you experienced in the

beginning of the same ones you're going

to go through throughout the game you're

just going to be running real fast away

from a spooky guy you're going to

squeeze yourself in between two butt

cheeks and get out of there and be safe

and at first it's a fun experience you

know you feel hopeless you can't turn

around and fight you can't find another

way you just have to run away as fast as

you can but it gets really stale after

you've done it for the hundredth time

throughout the campaign also in my

experience the hiding functionality and

this is really inconsistent sometimes

you can be standing next to them

whispering in their ear and they won't

know you're there other times you could

be lying face down in a pile of mud and

they'd smell your fart from across the

farm and come charging over at you but

overall the gameplay was solid I'd also

like to mention this game doesn't rely

solely on jump scares for its source of

scariness or terror which is a huge

welcome change in modern horror games

I'm going to slap this bitch on the

moist meter I'm going to give this an

80% this isn't even a $60 game so you're

getting a lot out of it for its price

point the gameplay is going to keep you

on edge throughout most of the campaign

the story is super interesting as are

the characters and horror game fans are

definitely going to want to get this one

it's a really good horror game I know

that's not saying much these days is it

really that good of a comp that big of a

compliment to say this game is better

than the fucking shit out there now oh

this one's better than Jack the rabid

stapler man but it is a great horror

game and not just a great horror game

it's a really fun game to play so yeah

that's about it I'm gonna go ahead and

wrap this episode up with a nice little

jingle I made up goodbye to the dry am i

what you bet

Moist Meter: Syberia 3

initiating moisture welcome to mmm you

moist meter University where our only

major is wetness and how to achieve it

the only student that showed up for

class today

this Siberia 3 how many of you are

probably unfamiliar with this Siberia

franchise that never saw a mainstream

success or anything but it did develop a

little cult following as anything does

these days actually saw a community

online the other day about people that

like to dress in rubber suits and shit

their pants and then just play with the

shit bulge

it was interesting but as to illustrate

the point everything has a cult

following and Siberia is no exception

so this new Siberia game is not a

full-price game it's a lower budget

title it's a $40 game and I really do

think you get a lot of bang for your

ballsack here at that price point now

the first thing everyone's going to

notice about this game is how dated it

looks it looks like it's out of the

early 2000s it looks like a PlayStation

2 title it looks like The Dance Dance

Revolution cutscenes you would see in

the background when you're boogying and

for a lot of people that's going to turn

them off now for me personally since I'm

familiar with the series it brought out

a feeling of nostalgia for me and I

really did just kind of enjoy the way

everything looked and how rough it

looked I know that's not exactly a

compliment or anything but at least in

my taste I liked it but I can totally

understand people who aren't familiar

with the series just immediately writing

this game off just because of how bad it

looks and make no mistake it does look

pretty fucking bad but there's a pretty

good game underneath the mediocre

visuals the story is compelling and it's

very interesting the characters

themselves are pretty interesting as

well I like the environment the

environment looks nice and it keeps it

fresh and it keeps you guessing as to

what's going on the puzzles are fun to

do they're not frustrating their fare

finding the objects is also kind of fun

exploring the areas is nice and you

don't really need to play the other two

games to really care about the story or

the characters in this game I think the

game does a good job of bringing you

into it which is good because a lot of

people haven't played the other games

the soundtrack is also really nice that

stood out to me on its own it's really

nothing special but everything just

sounds really good in the game and

really brings out like an eerie sense of

suspense which I like I think they did a

great job with that

[Music]

they nailed an atmospheric vibe here now

the gameplay is where one of my big

complaints comes in the gameplay is very

clunky movement you're like a fucking

tank that's drunk you move around like

you're in the fucking trance it's hard

to control your character everything

kind of buffers so if you hit a button

it takes about like a second sometimes

four to register that you press the

button which is just infuriating at

times it's like you're perpetually

lagging here and there's also a big

framerate problem on the ps4 which is

kind of just like a spit into my asshole

because this game really isn't too

graphically intensive or mechanically

intensive or anything like that I don't

know what's causing it to drops of 5 fps

sometimes when I'm running around this

game could have been made to be played

on a fucking Gameboy with fine fps I

don't know why the ps4 has a problem

with it I don't know if it extends to

the PC or anything like that but at

least on ps4 it did have framerate

issues now the game plays like a

telltale game like The Walking Dead

you'll have choices you have some

dialogue options the characters you talk

to will remember what you say and

they'll make note of it and it feels

very good it's a good way to use the

formula and it does a great job with it

I feel let's just dive into another huge

issue I have with this game and everyone

will have with this game the voice

acting is absolutely fucking abysmal

across the board the voices don't fit

the characters at all and there's no

voice sinking and the voice acting is so

uninspired and they even left in some

bad takes I noticed a few times

throughout the game the characters would

repeat themselves because their first

take was shit so they do it again but

they kept that first take in there in

fact at one point in the game a

character burp during what he was saying

and then just continued with that burp

in there and that pause following the

burp this wasn't a plan burp or anything

this man went off-book he fucking shit

on the script and said I'm doing this my

way

and then just burped and then continued

with the lines it wasn't something I'm

supposed to be there but they still kept

it there just because they lazily threw

it together it feels like it just seems

like all the voice actors just read

right off the script in one afternoon

they threw this together really quickly

and unsurprisingly the final product

comes out signing like an eighth graders

home movie

oh hello Kate Walker is everything all

right

Kate Walker who who are you

my name is Kirk Kate Walker in addition

to shitty voice acting the animations

are also pretty diarrhea they're not

great by any stretch of imagination I

mean they get the job done they can at

least convey the idea of what's going on

but fuck they are very bad at most

points another thing I forgot to mention

in terms of gameplay is the camera will

oftentimes not do what you wanted to do

or expect it to do for instance if

you're trying to walk through a door

you'll oftentimes just run into the door

or next to it and then when you try and

correct the problem you'll end up just

running in a circle doing like a fucking

donut and you can't really stop it since

everything buffers you'll try and

correct it but just end up being caught

in this endless loop like you're being

flushed down a toilet your character

just going to be spinning you can't stop

until you just let go of your controller

and wait for your character to stop

moving you just get caught in this

fucking endless vortex because the

controller and the camera don't really

work together very well and this extends

to when you're solving puzzles and

looking for clues so if you're trying to

angle your camera so you can look at a

wire that you can connect somewhere else

or look at a screw that you can unscrew

or read something or move things around

to find something underneath some

folders your camera might not respond

right away or do what you want it to do

it all kind of just boils down to luck

if you can manipulate this camera and

get it somewhere it's just kind of more

luck than you just actually moving it at

least through my experience playing this

game the camera is very inconsistent now

let's take everything I've said here and

translate it to the moisture content how

moist is the game how dry is the game so

I'm going to put this out about a 50% on

the moist meter I think this is the very

definition of an average game it has a

good story to tell

I enjoy the puzzle solving mechanics

there's a lot to explore and learn about

and there's a lot of cool little

mechanics here some of the puzzles are

very fun to do some of them not so much

but that's to be expected not every

puzzles going to be an enjoyable one and

overall I just feel like the game had a

lot to offer especially for $40 but the

overall clunkiness of the game and how

outdated a lot of this shit looks and is

and feels just holds it back from being

a better game just between the controls

not always working very

making it difficult to get your

character or the camera where you want

it to go the low-budget porn level of

voice acting and the non-existent

lip-syncing all of this just working

together really takes this game down

from being a good game to just an

average game and I think a lot of the

people that aren't familiar with the

series will probably write this one off

but I think for anyone that does like

the other Siberia games you will like

this one

I enjoyed it overall but I'm not going

to say it's a good or great game it's

just an average game and I think that

really just kind of sums up the

experience so yeah hello Kate Walker

Moist Meter: Yooka-Laylee

initiating moisture breaking news from

moist HQ it's raining tears because

ukulele was incredibly

disappointing spoiler alert

now I firmly believe a lot of games that

we used to enjoy growing up are just

games that were good for their time

going back and playing them they have an

age well perfect example is

double-oh-seven Goldeneye that games not

very fun to play these days so when we

think back to these games we look at

them through rose-tinted pussies because

we think of how great they were at the

time an exception to this is banjo

kazooie I think that game is aged well

and in fact actually marathon that game

before ukulele came out just to get

hyped up and just be excited for ukulele

but unfortunately all of that excitement

turned to excrement because this game is

quite shitty also my biggest complaint

about the game is just how uninspired

everything feels it all just feels

rushed and forced it doesn't feel

natural and it doesn't feel as confident

as banjo kazooie a good example is the

music that sometimes grant kirkhope will

shine like a bright nipple piercing

but then other times it's just some

generic music playing that's easily

forgetful unlike in banjo kazooie where

every tune was something easily

recognizable if you heard it outside of

the game the levels were also pretty

bland for the most part there were some

good levels in there of course but a lot

of them were just so boring to play

through and just tedious to get through

I swear some of these levels were made

in Halo Forge

it's just they didn't put much effort

into some of them it feels like the

characters also aren't very likeable or

interesting except for this snake I do

however like Yuka and Leigh Leigh I

think they're a pretty good combo I

thought they were very well designed and

kind of interesting but apart from just

these three characters the rest are just

so boring the game really just doesn't

seem finished it feels like there's a

lot they didn't implement in here this

feels like an early access title I'd pay

$5.00 for on Steam now let's talk about

the controls the controls are just

 abysmal for the most part banjo

kazooie and banjo too we had better and

tighter controls in this game this is

just a load of donkey farts and you have

as much control over your characters as

you would a bodybuilding uncle that got

too drunk and you're trying to lead them

home it's just so difficult to

get the character to do what you want it

to do you'll fall off of a Ledge because

you just couldn't make the turn sharp

enough if you're trying to control your

rolling ball just give up now because

that has a mind of its own

it's just I hated the controls now

sometimes the controls did work and then

those few instances where everything

just kind of clicked and the controls

were nice and responsive and things

worked the game felt great but between

the inconsistent controls and the just

horrendous camera you're going to be

frustrated more often than not when

playing this game let me make this clear

the camera there is nothing good I can

say about that bitch the camera is so

 horrible

it's just schmekel dwarfing to me how

banjo kazooie and - we would have a

camera that could follow you around

better than this one does now the

dialogue and writing I thought it was

fine I know a lot of people are

complaining about it but I like that

feeling I liked how it felt like an old

rare game in that regard the grunts and

random noises for the characters it

instantly hit me with a wave of

nostalgia and I still enjoyed it in this

new game

some of the dialogue was definitely

cringy and they went way overboard with

how many times they reminded you that

this is just a silly video game but

overall I didn't mind the writing or

dialogue or anything like that I thought

it was pretty good in fitting I also

enjoyed how there was a large selection

of abilities to use I thought that was

nice it kept it fresh you had a lot of

different at your disposal I also

just liked how much there was to

collect I'm a fan of the old

collectathon for the n64 in PSX era and

there was just a lot of here that I

could collect everything was

collectible that a collected diary I

never know what you're going to find

when you dig deep into there what kind

of treasures lie in wait and speaking of

diarrhea collecting and just assholes in

general the retro rex I hate the

arcade games in here

the little mini game mini queefs that

you have to play in here for some pages

from the dinosaur just don't even touch

him just avoid that at all

costs they're just horrible

so I sent this off to the scientists at

the top laboratories in America and they

sent it back and said this game clocks

in at about a 40% on the moist meter

this game just doesn't feel fun to play

there's nothing in this game that

banjo-kazooie didn't do better I'm a big

fan of the old collectathon games from

n64 and PSX era and I do believe that

they can be fun in today's modern games

but this one between the horrible camera

horrible controls uninteresting levels

uninteresting characters you're just

going to be more bored and frustrated

than you are going to be having fun and

it's unfortunate to say that because I

had high hopes for this game I supported

it on Kickstarter I was just really

expecting this to be great at grant

kirkhope it had the whole team back

together the boys were back in town but

unfortunately these boys were too dirty

to make a clean game it's just

unfinished and it's unfun it's

un-fuckin'-believable how bad the camera

was and it's unfortunate really it is

but hopefully they can learn from this

game and hopefully make a better

collectathon game or an old-school rare

game in the future that'd be nice

hopefully they don't just call it quits

because ukulele missed its mark but

until then stay wet so yeah

Moist Meter: Drawn to Death

initiating moisture hey there thanks for

tuning in to today's moisture forecast

brought to you by Charlie and Jackson's

weather nudes at 9:00 today's forecast

really fuckin dry not many clouds in the

sky today for drawn to death drawn to

death it's a new game for the ps4 from

the Bartlett Jones supernatural

detective agency and it's free for

PlayStation Plus members and $20 if

you're not on PlayStation Plus that

really shouldn't even be talked about

because there's no reason at all you

should purchase this game if you don't

have PS plus because you won't be able

to play it online which is the whole

draught of the game so you basically

just be paying $20 for a high schoolers

coloring book the games just a standard

third-person arena shooter but you have

some abilities tossed in there I know a

lot of people have compared this game to

overwatch because for some reason anyone

compares anything to overwatch I could

take a shit right now and they'd somehow

find a way to put that into the

overwatch universe and compare the two

this game is absolutely nothing like

overwatch it's just a very generic

shooter and there's nothing wrong with

that I respect that I actually not

trying to reinvent the wheel just

playing into a genre and trying to do it

well and it is competently made the game

works the guns work everything looks

really great the best thing about this

game is definitely the presentation I

like the visual style here in the

setting it's supposed to be a high

schooler's notebook come to life it

looks really great although it's a

little hard to believe that this

notebook truly belongs to a high school

or considering there's a severe lack of

butt-naked titties and pussies drawn in

here there's also no bad slam poetry or

rap lines in here but also spend my

disbelief just because I really do like

the visual style here the characters

look great they all have different

abilities that set them apart from one

another the guns are nice I like the

old-school style where you go and pick

up your shit to give you the edge so

that way it's not just loadouts that

really decide who's better you know it's

not you level up and you're instantly

better than someone who's the lower

level than you understanding the map is

what's going to give players the

advantage over the others and all the

maps look nice like I said I really do

just like the presentation of this game

I really like the way everything looks

now that's pretty much all of the good

stuff I have to say about this game

let's get into this stuff I do

like and there's quite a bit the game

just doesn't feel very good to play I

can't really put my finger on it the

characters just don't move very well

they don't feel super responsive the

melee may as well not even exist in this

game it just doesn't fucking work at all

if you try to melee someone it's about

the equivalent of just pulling your

pants down in front of them there is

never a situation where Mei Ling will be

the optimal choice there's also quite a

lot of network problems here the

characters will just start teleporting

everywhere you can throw your chainsaw

and then all of a sudden you have your

chainsaw right back to you it's like a

fucking yo-yo ball except unlike the

yo-yo ball advertisements this game is

not so much fun or easy to do take my

word from my nutsack to you aside from

just network issues the game is horribly

unbalanced right now which can be

expected from a launch title but it's

really bad while most of the weapons

feel good to use and they all look

really good and they're really unique

some of them are just pretty fucking

useless compared to some other ones for

example there's a weapon called the star

laser and it's just by far the best

weapon you have available and if you go

up against someone who's not using the

start laser it's basically like you're

the Death Star squaring off against a

gardener who whittled a handgun out of a

bar of soap it's just not a competition

you're going to win that every time and

this bad balancing extends to characters

as well there's some characters that I

think are just pretty fucking useless

and then there's some characters I think

are just way too good for example Allen

the chainsaw wielding teddy bear is by

far the best character in the game in my

opinion he just does a shitload of

damage and then he can go invisible

pretty much anytime he wants to so he

can just escape or surprise you with an

ass blaster there is no reason to not

play Allen especially when your other

choices or characters like cyborg yellow

which is just a glorified bolt or

because the only thing that fucking

useless thing can do is explode when he

dies it's about it he just

self-destructs another huge problem with

this game is the humor it's unbearable I

know they're going for that high school

type memeing humor but it is a meme

overload it's fucking ridiculous every

time you pick up some healthy announcer

goes fucking tasty you know that's not

bad one or two times every time you pick

it up fucking tasty fucking tasty

fucking tasty every single time

sometimes just randomly throughout your

match your narrative will say some weird

shit popping a hard

the boner for my rectum flaps am i right

everyone big common real Jackie Latorre

of masturbatory hey what's up it's like

the game was fucking written by Amy

Schumer it's just excessive there's

nothing wrong with using common boners

and stuff I love that kind of shit bring

it on

but to use it every couple of seconds

it's just just way too much now all this

considered by far the thing that I hate

the most is the ability to put a gift

with your character so when you complete

the game the little gift shows up and

then also during the game the gift can

show up and they're the worst memes I've

ever seen there's like a little kid that

just keeps zooming in on his face saying

I kill your face and it just makes me so

uncomfortable I wanted to turn the game

off the second I saw that I just wanted

to pull the fucking plug just hit the

fucking breaker switch on my apartment

just turn off all electricity no one

deserved it anymore after seeing that in

this game fucking disgraceful now let's

take everything into consideration here

and pop this bad boy into the lab and

put it on the moist meter I'm gonna

stamp this at about a 45 percent right

now at launch the game just has too many

balancing issues and Network issues a

lot of people are going to experience a

lot of lag a lot of time in between

games to try and find players to connect

with and get the game going but I do

love the way the game looks and I think

most people will like the way the game

looks all the guns are really cool all

of the weapons are great characters look

great and their abilities make them very

different from one another although some

are just completely useless while some

of them are just fucking unstoppable I

don't imagine this game having a very

active community for that long a time

unless they make some serious changes to

the network code and the balancing

problems that it's experiencing and also

toning down the amount of times it

mentions hard wieners but this is a

confidently made game there's clearly a

lot of effort put into it and it clearly

shows it's just it missed its mark but

this is a fun game just to kind of kick

back and play in small doses four or

five matches have some fun but past that

it's just going to get stale and you'll

probably be bored to death but most

people are going to be drawn to the way

the game looks and the way the

characters play so I thought about sums

up this chalk Zone for teenagers game so

yeah

Moist Meter: Persona 5

initiating moisture what's up pussy boys

and pussy girls you're watching moist

meter your one-stop shop for reviews

that put video games and movies on a

scale that tell you how moist the

product is why waste your time with dry

shit when you can get with wet shit

today's moist meter review is for

persona 5 for the ps4 this is the fifth

entry into the beloved persona franchise

I don't mean to spoil that for anyone

but I think the five and the title kind

of gives that shit away it's developed

by piece to do an Atlas turn-based JRPG

slash social simulator so this is great

for people out there that want to do fun

things with fun friends but don't want

to go outside to make fun friends or do

fun things you can make fun friends and

do fun things from the comfort of your

own home on this game with people that

don't actually exist now there's really

no carryover with the previous personas

into this game so anyone can pick up and

play this game and not be lost as to

what's going on and just like I did with

ghost in the shell' I'm not going to be

comparing this game to the other ones

I'm just going to review this as a

completely standalone experience so with

that out of the way

let's get into my favorite part about

the game which is the graphics the

visual style basically everything this

game puts in front of your fucking face

and it's beautiful this game is like an

exquisite dish of fettuccine alfredo

that I just want to dunk my head into

and never take my head out I just want

to live in that fettuccine alfredo

universe this game is just so fucking

beautiful the characters the

environments the anime cutscenes that

are sprinkled in there all of it just

absolutely gorgeous however I can't

acknowledge that the art direction in

this game won't be everyone's cup of cum

I know a lot of people will be

disappointed with the cartoony

comic-book vibe this game gives off but

for me it tickles my butthole in a way

that just makes me really happy the

whole city just looks alive there's

always some shit going on diving into

dungeons looks great fighting looks

great doing an all-out attack and then

watching the enemy get fucking

spaghettified in the vortex of turbo

Nishio unleash is always satisfying I

just really enjoyed everything about the

visual style now let's talk about the

gameplay here the game is going to take

about 80 hours to complete at bare

minimum there's just so much to do in

this game and it's divided into two big

parts part of it is going to be dungeon

crawling where you're diving into the

hearts of corrupted adults to try and

make them realize how bad they are as

people so that way they'll confess their

crimes and be a better person and then

the other half is just being a good

student and a good friend balancing

studying with hanging out with your Bros

to going on dates and still coming home

and having time to masturbate juggling

all of that I know doesn't sound like a

fun gameplay mechanic you know just

being a good Japanese high school

student but trust me it's actually a lot

more fun than you think now for about

the first eight hours the game was

really boring to me there wasn't a whole

lot of combat it was just me studying

for school learning about shit in class

being called a weird outsider if I

wanted that I could just go outside

right now myself and I just wasn't

really caring very much for any of the

characters or the overall story going on

but the more I played the game the more

I started to care about these characters

ah Ryuji what's going on man you got a

got to do a little better in school I'm

rooting for you you know they started to

become like my best fucking friends I'd

start blowing off my real life friends

on oh sorry guys I can't go out to happy

hour at the bar today I've already made

plans to go see a movie with taka Maki

song no I'm sorry guys I can't go out

tomorrow either I got plans for the

whole week I've got my Japanese college

entrance exams coming up I also have

part-time work at the beef Bowl shop

because my proficiency is kind of low

and I need a little extra money really I

just got a lot going on guys I'll be

seeing you in a couple weeks when I

finally beat this fucking game you just

get lost in the world really it does

grow on you it does become a lot of fun

there's so much to do batting cages

working a part-time job meeting people

building these relationships with the

characters that way you get some better

stat bonuses and some better abilities

and it's just a whole lot of fun but the

best part about the game is definitely

the dungeon crawling in the combat I'm a

big fan of turn-based combat always have

been and they do they do a really good

job in this game you get to fight with

personas that have a little special

abilities to them you can also mix and

match other personas combine them and

make better ones and capture new ones

when you defeat an enemy you can

sometimes hold them up for extra money

or items or even

after them like a really shitty and very

kind of nice kidnapper and it's really

just a lot of fun the gameplay in this

game both the social simulation aspect

and the actual doing shit aspect combat

aspect it's fucking beautifully blended

it's great I enjoyed both very very much

now the next big thing I want to talk

about is the story here I'm going to say

I didn't feel the overall story was that

interesting it wasn't bad by any stretch

of imagination but it wasn't amazing

either it was good it got there it got

everything going I got to meet a lot of

cool people and everything but I don't

think the overall thing the overall plot

that drove the main story was that great

although I did like it I'm just not

going to say it's mind-blowing or

anything superb but what I did find to

be the strongest part about the game was

the writing all of the side stories all

the characters were so well written all

the extra things you could learn from

just overhearing conversations or

working or meeting someone that works in

like the alleyway selling used condoms

all of that was beautiful

you can meet like a wizard operating the

glory hole in your local bathroom and

you might uncover some incredible

conspiracy about the reptilian humanoids

or something there was just always it

felt like everything had a big purpose

everything just felt real it felt like

there were actual repercussions and

actual things going on and I guess the

best thing to say about the writing is

it makes you feel like you're in the

world and that the people there exist

and feel a certain way the writing was

just some of the best I think I've seen

in the game in a long time and the

compliment did great writing was some

overall really good voice acting

there wasn't anything too overly bad or

too overly cheesy or overdone everything

just felt natural it felt good

felt like the characters voices matched

them the performances were delivered

great you could feel the emotions so you

left your hometown and you're living

here now huh no complaints there spot-on

some solid shit the only issue I took in

the overall writing and everything was

the main character doesn't talk you tell

him what options to choose from but most

of the options are pretty similar to

each other doesn't really matter what

you choose you're going to get the same

response from the character

but that's not my big issue I just don't

like how the character doesn't have a

voice himself he'll say one or two stray

lines every now and then but he doesn't

talk to the other characters and I just

don't like that that's a personal

preference I know a lot of JRPGs do that

with the main character but I'm just not

a fan of that he just reminds me of

myself when I was at a really awkward

stage in my life where I thought being

mysterious and not talking a whole lot

to people was cool I'd want to carry

around a deck of cards so I could

spontaneously do magic tricks to impress

girls and get their phone number

really dark period in my life and this

is just what it reminds me of he's just

the silent protagonist who doesn't say

anything to anyone except for the times

where you're given three pretty shitty

dialogue options on to the next thing

the soundtrack the soundtrack was solid

it was good a lot of smooth jazz some

little rock orchestra and never really

got boring or annoying never got tired

of it I thought this isn't saying that

it's amazing it wasn't anything to

wiggle your finger about or do the

Johnny Bravo monkey too but it was good

and people are going to like it I

thought there was really nothing wrong

with it the sound effects in the game

we're good some of the characters

sounded very similar to each other but

with so many characters having voiced

lines it's no surprise you can't exactly

find five thousand voice actors to do

ten thousand lines it's you're going to

get a lot of the same sounding shit

because you're going to reuse voice

actors to save some money to only read

one or two lines in a different voice

but what one of the big complaints

though for this department is I just

didn't like how almost every single one

of the corrupted adults sounded exactly

the same there's really no

distinguishing between them because

their voices were almost exactly the

same because they use the same effect

that's not a big deal I don't think it

makes the game unplayable or unenjoyable

I'm not going to dock 70 points off of

the moist meter for this one I'm not

going to say this game has psoriasis

just because a lot of the villains and a

lot of the characters sound exactly the

same now overall I think this game is

absolutely great but it is a very

slow-moving game a slow build-up it

takes a while to creampie on your face

and really blossom into something

beautiful you have to commit at least 8

to 12 hours to really start caring and

start understand

where this game is going and also the

things to do and really just grasp the

scope of this game and how much shit

there is to discover and learn about

this is a game that has a good story to

tell with great characters great writing

and just so much shit to do and you can

just get lost in the world

fans of the previous persona games are

going to love this game because it's all

of those games but much better it's much

better execution just everything is a

lot better combat dungeons all of it so

if you like the other persona games

you'll love this one

but for people that aren't familiar the

persona series or any of those games I

think most people will enjoy this if

they give it a chance if they commit

quite a bit of time to it but I

understand not many people will want to

do that and for people that don't want

to spend 12 hours before they really

start to care about a game this isn't a

game I would recommend to you but for

someone that doesn't mind a slow moving

game a slow build-up of a game this is

definitely one you want to check out for

$60 you can get 80 80 to 150 hours of

gameplay here I put 90 some into it

myself it's just an enjoyable experience

overall

now get your umbrellas out because it's

raining moisture up in this bitch I'm

going to slap this bad boy on the moist

meter at about an 85% that's where I'm

going to clock it at I enjoyed every

minute of this game pretty much

I didn't just play as Tuxedo Mask from

Sailor Moon I didn't just play as this

magical high school Japanese student I

became this high school magical Japanese

flailing arm tube man guy so yeah I mean

that's about it be moist be damp be wet

but don't ever be dry that's it so yeah

yeah

Moist Meter: Ghost in the Shell

initiating moisture what's up everybody

it's critical just saw a ghost in the

shell' and wanted to give it a review

and slap this bad boy on the moist meter

so grab a towel because we're about to

get wet up in this bitch now let me

start off by saying I am quite familiar

with the ghost in the shell' series I've

seen the original movie however I don't

want to compare this new one to the

original one I want to review this movie

as if it's the very first ghost in the

shell' anything brand fucking new name

no one knows what it means for all

people know it's about a haunted gas

station I just feel like a lot of people

write off movies when it's compared to

the original source material oh if you

love the original you'll love this a lot

of people will be left wondering well if

I'm not familiar with the original am I

going to like it is it worth seeing

so don't worry I'm here to get a boner

and answer questions and I've already

gotten a boner let's go ahead and start

with my favorite thing about this movie

which is the visuals the entire city

just looks fucking amazing everything in

the movie is amazing there's a lot of

CGI but a lot of practical effects and

practical effects just make movies

fantastic in my opinion it just raises

the visuals to a level you can't achieve

with just CGI and ghost in the shell'

really blends them both beautifully the

characters with the coolest shit

especially the enhanced characters in

this movie they looked like the fucking

feral offspring of a man in a terminator

at some point there was a gang member

and a club scene that had this weird

iron jaw he looked like Jimmy from Ed

Edd and Eddy

if Jimmy was really badass I really

can't gush enough about how spectacular

everything looked the environments the

characters just all of it so incredibly

pretty now let's talk about the

performances from the actors overall

everyone did a solid job Scarlett

Johansson I thought did a great job with

the major to really standout

performances from Bato and Aramaki

label of fucking killed that they

brought their characters to life and

just fucking stole the show every time

they were on so shout outs to them if

you're watching this just know I really

liked what you did in this movie and if

you want to come on the Internet's best

podcast the official podcast please just

reach out to me on Twitter now I should

also let it be known that I'd never

really harshly judge acting in a movie I

don't pay too much attention to it

except for acid butter but Qi

and miss Peregrine's Home for Imaginary

dweebs that was just the worst acting

I've ever seen and it really stood out

to me so take my acting criticism with a

grain of salt on this one because maybe

you won't find the characters did a

great job but I think most people will

agree Bato and armaki just nailed it now

on to my only real complaint about this

movie the plot now I'm not saying the

plot was bad or anything it was a decent

plot but it was very predictable and it

wasn't exactly original now that's not a

fair complaint that I have here because

I know the original ghost in the shell'

inspired a lot of modern sci-fi plots

that were used to like the matrix for

example and they wanted to stay true to

the original so they didn't have a whole

lot of wiggle room here but they did put

their own little unique spin on it with

the majors history and where she comes

from which I thought was a nice touch

but the plot never really captures your

attention you don't really feel too bad

when a character dies in the movie or

some big thing is revealed because you

kind of already saw it coming the

villain is by far the blandest character

in the movie just your standard cookie

cutter evil bro dude also the parts in

the movie that are supposed to elicit an

emotional response or maybe even be

thought-provoking really fall flat you

don't really care too much and the plot

twists can't really call it a plot twist

that's not really the wrong word I don't

think it's supposed to be a twist but

you don't really care you know what's

coming you know what's going to happen

it's not anything that's going to make

you tug on the shoulder the person next

to you all can you believe that shit

just happened aw man it just cleaned my

asshole I can't believe it so a lot of

things that were in there that I think

we're meant to make the viewer take a

step back and be like them what is it to

be human what does it mean just doesn't

really come across that way but like I'm

saying none of it none of this is me

saying the plot is bad just that it's

predictable and it's not a great plot

but the action scenes the visuals and

the characters really do make up for it

except for the villain because the

villains gets kind of shit I really

didn't like the villain another great

thing about this movie was the

soundtrack and just the sound in general

everything just sounded fucking cool

especially the soundtrack that's

something that really stood out to me

and will probably stand out to most

people they nailed it there overall I

feel like the movie was definitely worth

seeing even if you haven't seen the

original I think most people will find

that it was enjoyable for them to watch

it's nothing that you're going to

remember five to ten years from now and

reflect on but it's definitely a good

movie to just go entertain yourself for

two hours or so it's just a fun movie to

watch I'm going to go ahead and put this

movie at about a 70% on the moist meter

it's definitely got some moisture in

there quite a lot of moisture but it's

not dripping wet or anything but you

will definitely enjoy your time with the

movie so yeah that's it

stay moist or dry hard

Moist Meter: Mass Effect Andromeda

initiating Voyager Mass Effect Andromeda

is the newest and the Mass Effect series

from Bioware Mass Effect has always been

a series that's been near and dear to my

rear I loved one - and most of three as

like most people I was disappointed with

the insufferably shitty slipshod

slapdash abhorrent repugnant revolting

repulsive poopy fucking abysmal ending

to the Mass Effect 3 which really soured

the whole series for me but I still went

into this game with an open mind and

erect nipples and I didn't really have

too many expectations for the game and

yet I was still disappointed and let

down by it and after nearly 34 hours I

finally beaten the game and would like

to give a review more running bot

this will be graded on a scale of

moisture pretty standard-issue stuff

most school systems use them and this

will be no different so our moisture

meter goes from zero percent to a

hundred percent a hundred percent

reaches absolute moisture as with most

things in life the moisture the better

anything below a hundred percent shows

that there's some elements of dryness

some things that could have been

improved so now that we've gone over the

scale let's dive right into this shit

let's go ahead and start talking about

the presentation this is the best thing

about Andromeda some of the planets look

absolutely beautiful there's some

moments of genuinely calm inspiring

bliss seeing ancient technology come to

life looking at all of these foreign

alien environments it all just looks

very very nice however the same can't be

said for the characters the characters

look like dog shit I know I'm the

million person to talk about this but

the facial animations are just

absolutely terrible they don't look

human at all

they don't convey any emotions they're

like Rock'em Sock'em robots with some

faces painted on them it's just there's

very stiff it's like right out of the

police station one ERA lip-syncing is

just not even present in this game it's

like a bad lead of Jackie Chan movie

this is by far my suspect Andromeda's

biggest weak point it's just a very odd

feeling because it really seems like

Bioware just didn't biocare this time

around because in the other Mass

Effect's the characters really did seem

believable they conveyed emotion you can

kind of feel what the character was

feeling just based on how they reacted

to what you say etc here you don't know

what the fuck they're feeling or even if

they're feeling now I know that

complaint about the characters not being

believable as if they actually exist

makes me sound like a big fucking loser

like some type of anime body pillow

loving person who thinks it has a soul

but in a series that prides itself on

making the player feel like they're

making important decisions that actually

affect lives and actually makes the

player think it's really off-putting to

have the characters be like fucking sock

puppets where they don't have any type

of discernible emotions you don't really

feel bad for them and you don't feel

good for them either you just feel

neutral now apart from the characters

the game runs smoothly everything looks

really good in terms of the environments

and this

baseships and just pretty much

everything in this galaxy it all looks

good the map the galaxy map it's fucking

beautiful definitely the best of the

series could really just get lost in it

and exploring a lot of different planets

which is a lot of fun now let's talk

about the story this story is going to

feel very familiar to anyone that played

Mass Effect one you find some ancient

technology you also find a new alien

threat that wants to destroy the galaxy

that's basically what it boils down to

this remnant technology the whole

remnants very similar to the Protheans

you're very special and can use the

technology and learn about them that's

the main story in a nutshell and you

have to stop the people from destroying

the galaxy the side stories are just

completely fucking useless they don't

make any real impact on the overall game

or any impact in any regard whatsoever I

might as well just become a plumber and

started fixing shit on the Nexus which

is this game's equivalent to the Citadel

because no one cared about any of my

side stories even the characters I

didn't for didn't really acknowledge

anything I did there was just no point

to doing them that I found some of them

were cool a lot of the more tedious

especially in a particular Croghan

mission it was probably the longest most

boring most uninteresting story I've

ever done in the Mass Effect series I

pretty much just wandered around a

barren desert for an hour and a half

looking for car keys it was just

absolutely pointless now although the

main story is familiar it's not bad it's

delivered nicely it's just very

predictable and you're going to know

what's going to happen before it does

and how the game ends really the writing

in the game is just all over the place

sometimes there's some really good

moments some really good lines but a lot

of the time it's just really

cringe-worthy dialogue and it makes me

uncomfortable to listen to eating it PB

it wasn't the front door goodness

I'll let you know especially coming from

these emotionless husks of characters at

no point to any of the conversations in

this game feel like they mean anything

for instance there's a lot of political

disputes among the higher-ups on the

Nexus but it basically boils down to I

don't agree with that I don't like that

oh well thank you for your concern now

that I know you don't like that I

acknowledge it thank you for

acknowledging it let's move on and then

it never leads to anything it's just I

don't like it okay I get that I thank

you for understanding

and then the story just progresses

nothing fucking evolves from it and then

the conversations with Ryder and all the

other characters doesn't matter what

options you choose from the very limited

amount of options you have the

conversations going to still end up the

same you're extremely rude to someone

will be like well that was rude but I

forgive you and we'll still bang the

Paragon and renegade system from the

previous games is completely gone and I

know that was a very basic system but

the system they have in here now where

you just have a lot of different

dialogue choices it just boils down to

I'm going to be nice I'm going to be

mean doesn't matter which one I am

because we're still going to get the

same result at least in the previous

three games Paragon and renegade had

some consequences and in this game there

is no consequences to pretty much

anything you say and do voice acting for

the most part was awful really there was

no yelling or crying or any emotions

conveyed throughout this game not even

close

I can't even recall a single instance

where any character yelled or even said

something sad or felt sad it was just a

very stiff performance from pretty much

every character in this game obviously

there was a few that did a pretty decent

job with voicing their characters

whoever did track did a good job the

krogan really felt alive at some parts

it's complicated except it's not leaving

my scouts behind was worse than killing

them outright but overall the lines just

felt like they were read by students in

a high school doing a PowerPoint

presentation and reading off the slides

now my favorite part of this game was

definitely the combat I thought it was

really well done there was a lot of

options a lot of powers to toy around

with a lot of potential bills they

introduced it a new research and

crafting system so that way you could

make your favorite armor weapons or

augmentations which would change the

your guns behaved and it was really well

done however the squad commands they

were just completely gone

there it was just a really shitty system

for commanding your squad around not

like I had in the first three games it

was just it was useless I didn't use it

past the first few missions or so and

the squad mates overall were just pretty

useless themselves they didn't really

use their powers they didn't really fire

back they're mainly just floating pieces

of exposition to follow you throughout

the mission one of the things I hated

most about this game was just the lack

of new discoveries the lack of new

aliens

nothing really felt that foreign it's

all kind of like you know been there

done that I've seen all this before

there's only three new alien races that

played any role in the main story I

didn't find anything too alarming like

wow I haven't seen that in any other

Mass Effect games the audio sounded fine

everything sounded convincing and

actually at some points just really

improved the experience explosion

sounded really fucking cool it was like

you were in the action

Oh

[Music]

the soundtrack was really nothing

special it wasn't bad but it wasn't

anything that would really stand out to

you it's extremely forgetful it was a

king to me just banging on a garbage can

lid with a boomerang except in a much

more professional and better sounding

way so in fact nothing like me banging

on a garbage can lid with any type of

accessory it did point of making is the

soundtrack isn't anything to write home

about you're not going to hear any music

in here that's really just going to put

your jaw on the floor I know most of the

things I've said so far about this game

are negative however that doesn't mean

that my overall experience for it was

negative I had a lot of fun with the

combat and at some points I really did

feel invested in the characters until

that immersion was completely broken

when I just got a stiff response yeah

thanks for saving my family Ryder means

a lot I'm gonna go sleep now thanks

peace out pussy and that was the same

song and dance for every character

including the one that you romance that

was the most fucking pathetic romance

thing ever but a lot of the missions

were fun and I did enjoy my time on some

of the planets and just overall playing

this game I feel like that 34 hours I

had more of a positive experience than a

negative one although I have a lot of

issues with this game especially

compared to the genius of 1 & 2 but uh I

think the thing that really holds this

back is just how familiar everything is

and also how poorly executed it is

because if this was its first game in

the series if Mass Effect Andromeda was

a totally different thing there was no

Mass Effect before it I think people

would give it a lot more excuses for the

bad facial animations and a lot of the

other technical shortcomings but the

fact that we've seen it works so well

for three games in the past really just

puts a spotlight on how little Bioware

cared for this game i bios where they

just really didn't put their heart and

soul into this one now before I give

this game a warning I want to give

everyone out there a fair warning this

is not going to be i GN level grading

where anything's below a seven is

considered just trash and not worth your

time this is going to be some actual

rating where a 5 out of 10 is an average

game so anything above that is above

average

I fucking hate how the industry has

become if it doesn't get a 7 it's not

worth your time that's just so

unbelievable

stupid so I'm going to give this game

about a 55% on the moisture scale I'd

give it just a little above average

because it was an above average game

there's a lot of content here and you'll

definitely get your money's worth for

$60 but for fans of the series it's a

huge step in the wrong direction and

really just a huge step backwards about

10 years in terms of technology and it's

just not going to be that attractive to

people that aren't even familiar with

this series man it's good to finally see

you

Luigi's Mansion 14 Minutes 3 Seconds Any%

I've been practicing this shit all day

they're going to be my first full

attempt at speedrunning this is one of

my favorite games ever made but

unfortunately I blow the filthiest

rectums at this game so I know I'm not

getting the world record but I've

mastered the extreme tricks the turbo

stunts so I believe in the nipples that

believe in my nipples that I can get a

pretty respectable time well terrific

start couldn't even put out the candles

in a fast fashion but that's fine not

only lost me about five minutes my

wisdom tooth still hurts so just a quick

update on that which is why I'm still

talking with a bit of a lisp and sound

like the Mad Hatter farting through a

ham radio

now come on Nigel Thornberry picture

please hurry this up thank you and I

take it home John Adams portrait come on

I forgot how long this cutscene was

let's rock and roll let's get it started

and oh yeah oh fuck yeah I've got the

momentum now world record here I come

you trying to gargle this smegma toucan

or get this money beautiful that's how

we do it now I'm feeling it it's about

the extent of my talent at this game I

can't even just turn all the way around

there we go bingo bango Bungo

now we're fucking cooking baby give it

to me give it to me give it to me yes oh

fuck yes that wasn't too bad all things

considered and here's the first key not

to any of the times that teabag could

have been better I think that's all

right I'm not very good at this game me

playing this game is akin to a legless

beaver trying to build a dam so the fact

that even got past the room is an

accomplishment in and of itself please

don't thank you he was just doing me

dirty for a second

there's something strange in the

neighborhood were you gonna call JG

Wentworth 877 cash-for-gold

every time I catch a ghost I just get so

proud of myself and I love the way

Luigi's flaccid dick nose bounces around

with every step gives me something to

look at when I'm not giving getting my

lunch money taken by these two bullies

it double-fisted me I fucking like that

how you bitches like that fucking cross

the beans

not doing too bad at all actually I say

that and then I'm struggling with this

guy perfect okay there we go got him

come on what do you want what do you

want from me fucking flashlight ghost

please don't do this to me thank you

yeah I'm stay you know I'm not as bad at

this game as I thought I was like I used

to be a lot better when I was younger

but I guess it's like riding a bike you

never forget and speaking of that

expression that expression is entirely

false

you can absolutely forget how to ride a

bike a lot of bike about two weeks ago

and it was like trying to balance on two

coconuts I had no fucking clue what I

was doing I the second I bought it and I

walked outside I attempted to peddle it

you know ride it like a bike that you

know that's what you're supposed to do

it was a pedal a bike and you know ride

around you know move point A to point B

well the second I got on that Seabiscuit

I completely lost control wobbled and

fell off a curb and the car was turning

right at me and had to slam on the

brakes just to avoid blasting my ass it

was so embarrassing because not only did

I almost get hit by a car which is you

know it's kind of embarrassing in and of

itself but I did it right in front of

the shops owner right in front of the

shop and the whole thing's the whole

entrance is glass so I know he saw the

whole thing it was a small shop so I

guarantee he had a heart attack herbs

probably having a good old hoot about it

like huh just killed this guy you won't

make it a week on that bike well I sure

showed him look who's laughing now I'm

two weeks in and that was my closest

experience with a car not my only

because I fell off the curb about three

days ago but the car was far away so I'm

not too concerned with that when that's

just natural growing pains and getting

it getting acquainted with the Machine

becoming friends you know the idea the

point is whoever came up with that

expression it's like riding bike you

never forget full of shit they're

bullshit liar the expression should be

like riding a scooter you never want to

do it because it's embarrassing but you

never forget whatever it doesn't matter

same thing applies that would be a much

more realistic expression because no one

forgets how to ride a scooter no one I

don't think it's anyone the world that

wrote a scooter ten years later when two

scooters like what the fuck is this I

don't know how to do this I think I

think it is embedded in human DNA that

we understand how scooters work so that

should be the expression because I mean

really think about

riding a scooter doesn't take any type

of skill we don't need to be taught how

to do it no one growing up goes up to

their dad

head come on pops take me outside and

teach me how to ride a scooter we just

understand how to do it from the get-go

it's an inherent ability when we are

born we are born with scooter and

knowledge doesn't take any type of

balance or anything all it takes is not

crying when you're on the scooter

because you feel so bad about yourself

you can get over that fear you can scoot

with the best of them just boot scootin

boogie come on Chas Fenster give it to

me perfect fuck yeah I'm doing pretty

fucking well and I'm not even paying

that much attention there's been

reminiscing about my bike nightmares but

I swear to you in about a month's time

I'll be riding that bike with no fucking

handlebars always standing on the seat

I'll be doing fucking front flips on it

while still riding be a fucking BMX god

and that's not a BMX bike it's like a

two-wheeled demon but regardless I'll

master it this is about my best run like

all of my practice runs took me about

ten minutes to get here and I think I'm

only around like six or seven minutes

right now I come on Lady give it to me

come on yeah get in my vacuum fuck yes

beautiful I'm getting really lucky right

now I'll take it all right I'll go fuck

myself I guess she just fucking queefed

and broke the connection it's going to

cost me a bit of time but that's all

right I can make that all up once so I

finished the baby fight I just gotta I

just got to do it like Bubba Sparxxx I

gotta get it right get it tight and I

will find my miss new booty of Luigi's

Mansion speedrun records I'm definitely

not getting a record here spoiler alert

there's no fucking way the record is

like eight minutes and 50 seconds and I

think I'm already around seven right now

so there's really no chance at all but

still I can get around 1516 minutes

which is I think that's pretty good I

mean it's not good enough to get an

exclusive interview with aol.com

and you know I don't think they're gonna

really care too much about my Luigi's

Mansion record every time that's okay

because I don't like AOL anyway it may

be the most popular online website

service of the 1990s but still does that

mean I want to be interviewed by him not

at all but if anyone from AOL is

listening I am

available if you want to interview me

about my Luigi's Mansion talent it's

totally fine let me just go ahead and

shoot me a message on here on pornhub

calm on pornhub I am the big moist

whichever you feel more comfortable with

just feel free to reach out to me maybe

an electronic mail device sender that

could work too you want to exchange a IM

information or perhaps MySpace and put

me in your top eight and it's totally

fine to just get please AOL I miss you

no boy this is a long boss fight but

it's not a hard one once I get past this

it should be smooth sailing assuming I

don't fuck up any other tricks all right

come on you nerd baby you fucking baby

nerd look at look at that nerd baby look

it looks like a little little Jimmy

Neutron holding a lint roller yeah look

look at that little dweeb

that's a dork baby throwing throwing

wooden horses at me what is he a cow a

cowboy a cowboy nerd baby and what a

what a weird cat with Norton an old

western nerd baby weirdo fucking weird

baby that baby's gonna grow up to did

not even probably doesn't know how to

ride a scooter one cycle just give me

that legendary one cycle shit

pretty sure it's actually impossible the

one cycle this boss fight but that's

okay that is a-okay and do you know why

it's okay

it's because it really doesn't matter

because I'm not getting the world record

anyway that's that's why it's okay in

fact I could probably go right now take

a shit just let the game be on pause

come back then beat it and I still would

be in the same position as I am right

now not getting a world record alright

let's finish this off strong let you

finish this off strong throw me the

balls oh yeah

give me these give me one of these just

one thank you there it is rest in peace

baby stopped before you could even start

life didn't even get the chance to use

your ability to ride a scooter that's

sad but it had to be done now here we go

another run gets fun this is where I

just take over this is where I assume

direct control I'm just taking the game

by storm right now the coach put me in

here right now the coach was like we

need the all-star so that's what they're

getting they're getting the fucking

all-star they're getting the bull the

horns and the cock I'm the whole package

is that enough skew that better be

enough ski oh please come on shit please

just come on thank you oh I was lucky

that was close that's actually really

that's really lucky I usually never get

that in one try

oh don't do this to me bats don't do

this to me bats oh come on come on you

ectoplasmic sperm cells justjust come

here why are you being so stubborn why

you doing this to me thank you I don't

get this what what this isn't even

supposed to be hard just why are you are

you giving me the big filthy right now

why you beefing me like this just giving

me that big old beef cannon for no

reason I've never struggled with this

part please yes please how about maybe

please just please come on thank you

fuck finally alright twenty minutes

later now I'm ready to get a decent time

perfect gotta line this up right give it

something come on beautiful steel oh

that is textbook that is fucking

textbook when you open a biology

textbook this is what you see on every

page right here Luigi up like this ready

to fuck you in your mitochondria alright

now we're cooking I'll fuck this up a

few times but I'm usually pretty

consistent let's hope I can pull it off

alright let's get it let's get it come

on come on come on get it yes

oh fuck yes alright this is the hardest

part of the run if I can do this part it

should be smooth sailing from there

alright let's do it

yes oh fuck yes there's Mario over there

in the void

I'm coming Mario don't worry don't worry

I'm coming really I'm coming I'm coming

damn it I'm still coming yes yes fuck

yes fuck yes holy shit a lot of times if

you step out of line if you don't walk

like a really specific path in there you

just get cemented down and can't move

and it just locks the game so you have

to restart holy fuck

well if I was only better at the

beginning this would be like

world-record pace but I really I suck

Winky hole at the beginning so I never

had a chance

oh what am I at right now like 15

minutes or something I can get a decent

time it's not bad at all boss fights

super easy so I shouldn't really

struggle there I'll take it I mean

overall not bad especially since half

the time I was just thinking about bikes

and scooters so you know I'll take

anything shy of two hours because bikes

and scooters really that takes a lot of

brainpower to think about so the fact

that I was able to you know

compartmentalize bikes and scooters and

Luigi's Mansion and titties and stuff

and you know I'm proud fun fact I

actually only beat this game once in my

life like actually playing it through i

beaten it four times now since I learned

the speedrunning route so I've gotten

some practice but I know how fun that

fact is I know everyone right now is is

really just squirming in their seats

while that fact was so fun holy shit so

at least now if you hated everything you

saw throughout this video you can at

least say you learned a nice new fun

fact there we go and give me that what

the fuck okay all right yeah I'll

probably just it killed by Bowser now

that'll be that'll be a real poetic end

to this run well I can't believe I just

fuck that up I really can't believe I

just fucked that up it makes me a sad

Boy Scout okay yep I'm just getting I'm

just getting pounded right now I'm doing

it to myself I have no one to blame but

myself

I have 30 health yeah I'm probably gonna

get killed by guys right here

holy shit while this is really bad this

is abysmal

I'm fucking ashamed of myself right now

I'm absolutely fucking disgusted at

myself please

come on me come on me come on are you

fucking kidding me well are you fucking

there fucking right now I they are

fucking this game is just fucking that's

what it is it's fucking I can't even be

mad it's just fucking that's all that's

why the game called me right now to say

I'm fucking you but I already know that

I can't answer that I'm fucking busy

luckily they hung up so they got they

got the message of like shit I think I'm

calling during prime Luigi Luigi's

Mansion speedrunning time and twenty

health that's plenty that is ample you

know what I can do with twenty health do

you know the things a human being can do

with only twenty health and Luigi's

Mansion they can get a fucking

respectable speedrunning time that's

what they can do that's what I can do

and please long as I don't hit my long

as I don't get hit by fucking Ice Cube I

should be fine please get those fucking

snow balls out of my face yes yep yes

yes time what did I get

well I don't know why I'm asking what I

got I don't have my fucking timer on the

screen right now it's in the background

and I don't feel like minimizing this

right now right now I'm just gonna take

this all in can't believe everything

actually work together while holy shit

my first full speed run attempt are you

kidding me are you fucking kidding me no

you're not

because that wasn't very good but I'm

happy with it and I'm proud of it and

you know sometimes in life it doesn't

matter what other people think you're

speedrunning times it's about how you

feel about those speeding times if

you're happy with them and you deserve

to be happy about them but if it's not a

world record it's not even worth the

time I'm fucking disgusted at myself

right now probably like 20 minutes

probably 20 minutes beating this game

I'm fucking suck dick for money that's

what I do I'm fucking I'm fucking angry

I need to get better but I'm not going

to I really don't care I'm pretty proud

of my speedrunning time here I'm just

happy I beat it all in one try I'll take

it

yeah all right that's it

Spyro E the D 1 Minute 30 Seconds Any%

I love rainy days like today for wasn't

speedrunning this game I'd probably be

doing what I usually do where I just

look outside and watch it all come down

and as the rain fogs up my window and I

can't see it all I'll think to myself

what's Gashi Eddie doing right now

what's he eating and blood will rush to

my wiener so I imagine him whispering

into my ear Slamma jamma parmigiana and

I feel a small amount of semen escaped

my now erect and throbbing cock come on

I hate this shit guzzling piss mosquito

so hard to skip that dialogue I've only

done it once

yep I'm off to a great start here I come

world record it's not too bad I don't

think I can get the world record now but

I can at least get a respectable time I

just got a wisdom tooth removed so

that's what I'm talking with a bit of a

lisp sorry about that

I know it's frowned upon in the dental

community to speedrun right after

getting a wisdom tooth taken out but if

I didn't do it who else would in fact

when the dentist removed my third molar

he said to me with tears in his eyes

Polly son don't speed run not for at

least four days it's just too much

stress on the mouth and I looked him

back and I said doc there's only two

things I know for sure in life that

nipples make milk and I was born the

speedrun could no longer hold back the

waterworks he broke down in the office

but he knew I was right when he regained

his composure he gave me a salute and

said

Godspeed soldier may you speed those

games run fast so I took my leave and I

whipped out my vape fog smoke marijuana

cush dispenser machine and took a puff

as the office burst into flames behind

me hey fucking kidding me I'm hardly

been paying attention this boss fight I

don't think I've ever taken damage in

this boss fight and I've already taking

damage twice three times great in my

tack count perfect good I didn't really

upset if I failed this boss fight this

was a pretty decent run and I would have

been really sad Boy Scout if I had to

redo it especially because I really

wouldn't want to talk about my MIT

Devil's Share PB 1 Minute 44 Seconds 100%

I've had this game since it first came

out because there's not a shitty game

that I haven't played at least once but

for some reason my computer couldn't

handle this game in particular it would

be nothing but a black screen and sound

effects that sounded like diarrhea being

shot out of a trombone but today I saw

it my Steam library lonely and looking

for friends and I was reminded of the

flurry of emotions I felt way back when

I first bought it the disappointment and

the sadness and I decided to give it

another chance turns out my computer is

mustered up the strength and courage

necessary to run this ethereal piece of

filth and I also learned that there are

speedruns for this game so I've mastered

the route and hopefully I can break the

world record which is 116 but if not I'm

just gonna go for a respectable time

let's fucking go

devil cher more like devil share the

world record with me yeah go fuck it

yeah I'm in it to win it now some people

are addicted to cocaine and heroin and

porn and even eating mattresses but I'm

pretty sure all those are more socially

acceptable in my strange addiction which

is speedrunning anus video games I don't

know why I liked it so much but I really

do but I can't help but feel like it's

kind of just a big waste of fucking time

but it doesn't matter speaking of time

I'm not a fucking good pace right now

this is world-record pace get the fuck

out of here popped in the nose no get

away it's my purse you want some of this

shit - over there didn't even need to

shoot that guy but I did because my

accuracy is pinpoint really I just don't

even think I can miss a shot except I

can clearly miss this objective great

that's gonna set me back a little bit

I'll make up for it up but not here I

guess alright that's a great magic trick

Thank You drawer get the fuck out of my

way

mutant fetus Walker what an incredible

spectacular magic trick from the amazing

drawer now you see the world record now

you don't it's a real crowd shock or a

doozy

now I'm extremely behind but this is by

far my best run so far so I'm happy just

got to believe in myself and encourage

myself and know that I can do it

splendid yes yes Thank You friendship

nope just keep it up just keep shitting

right in my fucking face if I was Tom

Sawyer I wouldn't paint that fence

fucking hate that fence now I can't open

the door there we go alright

should probably explain uh rip really

real thank you she probably explain the

technique for this game so you can pick

up every objectable from across the

entire universe just as long as you're

looking at it so I just pick shit up

from far away and that's the whole thing

like I'm actually planting the bomb on

the house from here as you can see I

opened the door and now I close it my

fucking face I'm doing great

nope whoops one come on come on there it

is time oh yeah really on the heels of

the world record here the cusp really

knock it on its door well whatever I'm

Candles WR 1 Minute Any%

they say that every squirrel gets a nut

but I'm implying this for about now

we're trying to get the world record and

I've yet to nut I really hate how dark

this game is it's like when you're in

the in the woods at night and it's

really dark outside you know it's dark

that's what this is it's really dark you

know what I'm talking about when it's so

dark you can't see your own titties in

front of your face but I'm almost to the

house so that's good I'm making pretty

good time I guarantee I'm gonna it

up but it really doesn't matter I'll

just sit here with tears in my eyes and

try again get out of my way door light

the candle that's how we do it that's

how you light a candle right

there in case you didn't know candle

lighting tutorial 2016 Khmer chair give

me this piggyback ride oh yeah how's

good bounce alright here it is the run

ender got a spin this block of

tofu at the speed of sound come on come

on oh yeah alright this is a chance

cannot my pants come on in the

words of little wheezy I've seen Knights

full of pain days of the same you keep

the sunshine save me the Wiener get me

in there oh there it is there it is

that's a world record only by three

Zombie Hell WR 57 Seconds Any%

this is going to be a new world record

and I can say that with 100% certainty

because I'm the only pussy fired

speedrunning this game I've come up with

an optimized route I couldn't possibly

be improved upon and I can say that with

100% certainty because I have a little

bit of hair on my nutsack and I just

completed the first section that was

pretty good time and it was a little

hard to keep up with I was doing some

advanced movement tech that's hard to

follow but it's only gonna get crazier

here's the first trick of the run I

fuckin nailed it that's a textbook gate

open can I do it twice I opened two

gates

I'm truly the king if you ever found

yourself stranded in ancient Egyptian

ruins looking for keys being chased by

3d zombies you'd want me on your team

because I could probably help fuck dis

dom be so 3d I've got to kill him that

stunts gonna cost me a few seconds there

was really no reason for me to have

killed that zombie I could have

progressed without doing it but he was

standing there minding his own business

so I decided to give him the business

Bank his ass cheeks around a little bit

I'm coming up on the final door so I

think I'm gonna get a sub minute run on

this one this is looking good this is

looking good they didn't even bother

attacking me I was zooming by so fast

time that's a new world record although

it really could have been anything it

could have sat here for seven hours and

got in the world record still I'm one of

only five people to have played this

game the other four being probably

family members of the creator but none

of that matters all that matters on this

christmas day is this powerful message

you throughout your tired body hardly

from war endure what would happen after

that who was waiting for you those are

questions I ask myself every morning but

I got a new world record and that's what

I'm happy about and in the wise words of

Abraham Lincoln four score and seven

years ago our fathers had wieners and

thanks to those cocks were here today

you know I don't think we stop and thank

our dads enough for their dicks I know

me personally every father's day I write

my dad a handwritten thank-you card

thanking him for using his penis

properly because if he hadn't I wouldn't

have just gotten a world record on 3d

Two Worlds PB 2 Minutes 13 Seconds Any%

I've given up on beating the world

record for this game I don't see anyone

ever beating the world record for this

one aside for maybe God himself and even

he would be sweating pretty hard but at

least one a time on this one I can be

proud of when I can put on my

refrigerator my own little PB penis

blaster see what I can do here come on

oh yeah they had nipples until I fucked

them oh it's not too bad it's pretty

decent time and here comes the tricky

part

this is where it gets really exciting so

if you're on the edge of your seat stay

there also I might as well might as well

address this I know the graphics look

abysmal I know most you probably think

you're looking at various vegetables

moving around in a salad but this is by

my design I made a conscious decision to

turn the graphics down as low as they

could possibly go just to see what kind

of lego adventure I could embark on here

which is also why my character here

resembles an Ewok my apologies I haven't

really been explaining my techniques

here and what's going on I know it's

kind of hard to follow some really

advanced maneuvers being displayed here

I'm running straight and I'm gonna

continue to run straight for about 30

more seconds until I make it to the

final boss the final boss is in the

first village his name's ghandahar he's

an asshole the strategy is to have him

attack the villagers the villagers get

all up in titties and fight back and

kill ghandahar for you that's game over

it's actually how the game is meant to

be beaten and I'm about to beat this

bitch like an egg this is probably my 50

or 60 if the temp somewhere in that

ballpark but I'm feeling really good

about this one turn around pussy fart

for I really fooled him now he thinks

for playing golf a little does he know

this isn't golf it's a lot less fun good

evening ladies and gentlemen please move

over Cletus let me get on this rock no

this was a lovely rock I'm having fun

I'd really hate if someone hit me with a

fire ball oh no my the worst case

scenario happened get him boys give him

the business I just can't believe that

he came to this village all on his own

and flexed for no reason what a mean guy

now I just wait for the villagers to do

my dirty work work so dirty micro

wouldn't rub his asshole with it alright

come on now you guys are better than

this it's 45 on one please is this

really the best you can do are you even

attacking and what the fuck is this are

you licking him to death

how many licks does it take to get to

the center of a ghandahar finally I just

wait for the cutscene to activate all

right I'll go fuck myself I guess no

there we go finally time

well it's 13 seconds off the world

record but I don't give a fuck I'm still

just as happy as the people that won the

Powerball I'm proud of this one

shave this Zoo give me that now

to dig some shallow graves for the

previous world records on this game time

to zoom out of here

swag boosters activate Oh jinx I forgot

to give the Chiefs Wiggles to the yellow

 damn you baby Jamba I don't think

it's even possible to get a world record

anymore but I think I get a respectable

time so I'll be happy with that

putt-putt saves a zoo in a reasonable

amount of time not world-record pace but

I think it could be good come on you

 four-wheeled pink slipper we can

do better than this we're better than

this dammit come on get me in there get

get me in there oh yeah I'm in there

like Linds Flair iced rice The Price is

disgusting Nigel Thornberry would be

absolutely beside himself if he saw how

long it was taking me to save these

innocent animals oh

nailed it bingo bango Bungo come on come

on and there it is just like that the

zoo is saved time

two minutes and six seconds huh yeah

that's embarrassing I'm

surprised the animals didn't die of

starvation before I came to their aid

the world record was 41 seconds I

believe so I was right on the cusp of

that obviously you know I actually used

to play the putt-putt Series when I was

a young boy back when I used to believe

every inanimate object had a soul he

used to go out of my way to be kind to

them and talk to them to let them know

that I want to be their friend since no

one else did there's actually certain

chairs I wouldn't even sit on because I

didn't think they deserve to be

suffocated by my ass cheeks but yeah I

mean I haven't played putt-putt since

then and it's kind of cool to beat it

now and then feed it in a pretty decent

time so proud of that that's it so yeah

was confused neither understood why this

happened it's not like he went into the

dumpster and took out a pound of old

Turkey and housed it he didn't eat

anything unusual so why did he have this

reaction deep down I knew the answer to

this it was my fault truly for I hadn't

speedrun a game in a while and my

father's disappointment was swelling up

inside of him so this morning I woke up

I masturbated and I made a decision I'm

going to set a new world record today

but I'm not just doing it for myself

this is for you dad I found a game

called near midnight which has a world

record of 24 seconds which is held by

Papa long Johnson himself unimaginative

handle you might recognize that name

because I've slaughtered a few of his

other World Records on bad video games

and this one's going to be no exception

I'm coming for that shit baby

gonna I'm going to watch it to wit with

a new world record

WR Stalin Subway Red Veil 8 Minutes 31 Seconds

this is what separates the hard disks

from the semi chubs I'm coming for that

world record of 855 get my sights set on

it target locked

I'm like Rudy toe bootie except I don't

have the truck I have a world record

that's a one shot one kill right there

that's a pixel perfect frame management

rng manipulation perfection it's not

even an aimbot just natural talent maybe

I was born with it

maybe it's mabeline that's a beautiful

fucking grenade just got to pick them

off now Hawkeye's run and clean up up

here

pinpoint accuracy beautiful I'm a real

sharpshooter Special Forces may be super

trained super soldier top of the class

in dance therapy I'm coming in boys Let

Me In knock knock what are you fucking

kidding me

put the bullet right in his mouth and

eat it like a turkey meatball got on my

way pussy boys I got a world record to

get here and coming through also I might

as well mention in the beginning of this

I turned the sound off because this game

simply does not run when you have sound

done so part of the game design

philosophy so you can't really fault

them for it was a decision they decided

to make really the games a lot better

without sound it's a unique experience

that's truly innovative and it really

puts you in the perspective of the deaf

person playing a shitty game not about

time on the first mission despite the

blunder of picking off the people

exiting the clown car see if I can make

up for lost time on this one I'm pretty

solid right there let's get into it a

good old bulletproof bill over there

once again just fucking absorbing the

bullets dammit dammit shit shit oh now

we're fucking cooking they don't call me

soggy sack Mick world record pack for

nothing oh it's beautiful

alright so here's a trick coming up that

I actually discovered by a complete

accident because I'm a fucking

incompetent homunculus so if you run

this game in compatibility mode you skip

level three that brief flicker was level

three and now I'm loading into the next

one immediately that's something I

discovered that all of the stolen subway

Redvale speedrunning community' will be

using all three of us not trying to flex

too hard it's just kind of you know I'm

the smartest guy in the world when it

comes to speedrunning useless and shitty

video games

I'm just blasting ass right now on time

I am just cleaning the anus of the

previous world record so the previous

world record by Timothy at 8:55 didn't

use the level 3 skip because I the

Alexander Graham Bell of Stalin's subway

hadn't invented

yet so the fact that I use this

innovative trick in this run should give

me a sizable lead here and shave a lot

of pubic hairs off the previous world

record should be able to be two by at

least a minute now this is my least

favorite part of the run there's really

not much to do here except wait you have

to wait for the toilets to overflow and

just flood this whole basement you can

make the process go faster by doing a

series of fast saves but I can't do it

as fast as the other speedrunners for

this game and I say that is if there's a

lot of them as if this is an active

community of people speedrunning this

pile of ass but there was really only

two people who ever ran this game and

that was a year ago so it's not exactly

a flourishing category here but now that

I've broken new ground by being able to

skip level 3 people should be frolicking

to this game to speedrun it there was

150 thousand people who speed ran this

game now it's a ghost town I definitely

thought that was high enough for the

water

okay now we're fucking good to go the

dog is off the leash and the dog needs a

drink but don't get the dog a drink

until you ask for its ID to confirm that

it's 21 years or older making good time

on this level actually that's right the

fastest I've ever done the flooding that

shit was beautiful the door wouldn't

open for me out of my way gentlemen I'm

coming through I hear there's a killer

Black Friday deal at Macy's this year

man I just can't wait to get those

macy's items come on out of my way I'm

coming baby I'm making fucking fantastic

time flanked on the fucking master

tactician some zoos art of subways baby

fucking scoot it in there alright this

is definitely world-record pace this is

the fastest I've done it so far finally

I've been trying to get the world record

on this putrid stillbirth of a game for

two days now fun fact I actually haven't

showered since I started speedrunning

this two days ago it's not a direct

correlation I haven't been postponing

personal hygiene for this game it's just

I just haven't showered in two days I

guess I know that's disgusting I know

many of you just recoiled on your shoes

see it's a yucky icky oh goodness

gracious two days without a shower and

trust me I'm thinking the same thing

whether or not I get a world record on

this run doesn't even matter this is a

fucking great time

at this point might as well just try out

the risky strategies and by that I mean

the only strategies because this whole

fucking game is incredibly difficult to

speedrun that's alright I'm putting in

the time and the effort as Vince

Lombardi used to say it's not all about

showering

sometimes it's about world records Vince

Lombardi was one of the finest

speedrunners of stolen subway back in

the day

get out only fucking kidding me goodness

me that man just fucking belly bopped me

three inches back that's I might as well

just reset now just threw me off come on

baby give me it on the first try oh well

you gave me it on the first try we

fucked on the first date oh you oh you

are just what I wanted oh my fucking

goodness yes if I blow this world record

now I'm going to be very upset extremely

upset

I might even be upset if I don't get a

world record now but this is the hardest

level in the run by far this is going to

test what it means to be a man no I'm

not a man oh I am a man big man second

try I'll fucking take it ok now this is

the one that's going to separate a man

from a real man y'all fuck I'm not a

real man come on I'm losing cut I'm a

fucking man damn it what the fuck come

on

yes yes yes now I'm cooking I'm not

cooking anymore please please come on

stay on I'll just fucking grinding it

like Tony Hawk baby

that's a fucking 70,000 point grind

right there

oh my fucking goodness please now I've

gotten a lot of bad luck on these

gentlemen here some double-oh-seven

goldeneyes shit here on the expert

difficulty these guys got a fucking

grudge they usually take me out and I

have a lot of health right now I'm doing

really well

I just can't blow it I'm fucking nailing

it I'm doing it I'm doing it big I'm

doing it live this is for you dad all

those times you told me I never hold the

world record install in subway red veil

I'm going to show you what you were

wrong about and it was that because I'm

gonna have the world record please know

the firing squad all but I'm firing back

baby yes

now I've really done oh shit oh I just

swallowed a burp I've done super well on

these last two levels I don't want to

blow it now but I'm really blowing it no

no I'm not blowing it not anymore

don't think I'm blowing is my fucking

load no I'm blown it no shit

there we go perfect fucking snowboarding

on him it's actually my favorite

strategy in any speedrunning games where

you just walk on that guy oh this is

beautiful

this is the second to last level now

it's the last level this this is where

history gets made this is where history

books get rewritten and then you have to

pay an extra five hundred dollars the

next year for the outdated history book

that didn't have this speedrun in it I'm

pretty sure I've made that joke and

another speedrunning thing but it

doesn't matter because right now I'm

just in the fucking zone I'm dialed in

and I'm ready for a speedrunning world

record I'm getting that tingling

sensation and the tip of my penis yet

again it's throbbing all my fucking

goodness if I fuck this up on be so

tight in fact I'll probably just not

even speedrun this again because if

there's no way I'm going to get a run

that matches this the intensity the

passion that I'm putting into this you

can just feel my erect nipples leaking

through my voice you're a beautiful shot

oh my goodness just one more trick is

one more trick but it's a do as you come

on pull it off no I'm pulling off is it

rusty condom no please no come on oh my

fuck I'm blowing it it's over it's not

over it's never over shit come on

can't look at the time right now I

better be ahead of the world record time

otherwise wouldn't be so upset

come on glob he should bust through that

wall any second now superhero style

come on Gleb what the fuck oh shit there

it is time glove just sprinted through a

hail of gunfire for this world record he

knew what it meant to me while the game

crashed Wow beautiful timing I'm so glad

the game even was on my side it waited

til the end of the run to crash this is

a new world record

this is fucking legendary you know

honestly I

be proud of it though because the world

record previous world record of 855 was

with a whole nother level attached to it

so that man did so much better than me

that he was able to complete a whole

nother level and almost still beat this

time that I got despite me skipping it

but still you know what I don't care no

shame I got a new fucking world record

baby I am now the owner of Stalin's

subway that shit is mine I did it the

fastest this unleash our word hairy man

is now the Emperor of Stalin subway red

Bale I'm the speed running master

Turbo WR House of Caravan 11.8 Seconds

what's up everybody that's critical some

of you may know me as the house of

Caravan world record holder others may

know me as the man whose penis has never

been soft sorry to say both of those

titles are now inaccurate my pride and

joy the thing I was most proud of in my

life my house was caravan world record

was recently broken my record of 12.4

for six seconds has now been beaten in

the new record is twelve point four four

two seconds truly a substantial

improvement I must now dust the shit

stains off of my house of Caravan game

and once again reclaim my throne as the

world record holder I've been tasked by

the Pope himself to reclaim this world

record I'm on a holy mission and in the

words of Bruce Wayne spoiler alert

Batman it's not what a man does that

define I just want this fucking world

record back what the fuck is it this is

just impossible

I actually think 12.4 is the absolute

limit of this game I don't think it's

possible to do it faster I really don't

but unless I'm gonna keep trying cuz I'm

fuckin curse to just keep fuckin trying

this was a good start I like that the

cleanest dirty boys about to do it I'm

feeling it oh please

my asshole stays wet baby give it to me

tuck hmm yes just when you thought I was

clean I showed you I was dirty I fucking

did it

nailed it new world record closing the

game that's the equivalent of a mic drop

in the house of Caravan community fuck

yes I really hope this one doesn't get

beaten but I fucking did it

mm-hmm yes that's right blasted ass with

the freshest filthiness my asshole never

gets wiped holy shit I cannot believe

actually out of sub 12 second run all

right well truly hoping that this record

will stay because uh about five times in

the past now I said the world record

will outlive the universe itself and

that has been disproven each time so I'm

just going to say that this was a good

run hopefully no one beats it when I say

caravan you say world record terra van

world record at house two as well throw

that in there somewhere I'm the house of

caravan world record again Yahoo so yeah

Porn Game Speedrun World Record

yeah I know it's been a while since I

the almighty undisputed Lord of

speedrunning have dunked my dirty ass in

the speedrunning bathtub but I decided

it's time to re-enter the crucible and

claim a world record

just like Golden Superman when he sat in

the Sun for a thousand years gathering

energy that's what I've done on a much

larger scale so I'm coming back and I'm

definitely getting a world record here

this is on a porn game called game of

moans if he followed the official

podcast you know that our friend Jackson

made this game a couple months ago and

put it out since then it's been getting

frequent updates but the first version

he published is this version and in this

build there's a game breaking bug an STD

if you will that allows you to beat the

game way before you should be able to so

with an optimized route that I've

calculated and put into practice here I

should be able to beat this game in

under a minute when normally it offers

far more than a minute to worth a

gameplay unless you prematurely

ejaculating all the build-up and also

all of the sex and porn so let's go nuts

to butts here time starts once I hit

enter on my name so let's begin now I

need to start by apologizing to all of

you watching in Jesus Christ himself

because I am going to be skipping

through all the actual pussy's titties

and ass and penis I know it's kind of a

sin to miss that in a porn visual novel

but for the sake of the speedrun it's

got to be done now I'm coming up on my

first skip here hopefully I can pull it

off oh there we go got the hands of a

fucking surgeon what can happen there is

you miss click on bran and click the

door and it cost you a few milliseconds

Oh like I just did right there with Sir

Roderick yeah fuck Roderick is the eater

of runs the amount of times that he

sidesteps my mouse just jukes me out

makes me click the door behind him is

immeasurable that man just fucking

obliterates great runs I'd reset if I

didn't have such a good brand skip I can

still get world record here could still

get under a minute as long as I pull

this off properly as long as Roderick

doesn't take me over isn't he in spank

me again with his penis coming up in the

most technically difficult portion of

this run I have to make sure I get this

rabbit on the first try come on baby Oh

perfect that's expert marksmanship right

there all of those years of FPS gaming

at the highest level are finally paying

off this is the speed run to finally put

me in the history books beside the hint

high speed running greats like well I'm

sure there's a few people that speedrun

hentai games besides me

come on baby people fuck I just went the

wrong way oh shit shit that's a time

loss that's right we're still making

spectacular time come on baby come on

give it to me

bang time a 123 is not bad it's

definitely world record but I truly

think I could have refined this and got

it under a minute

now if any of you have played game of

moans you know this isn't the true

ending but I can't speedrun the true

ending on YouTube but I'll show you

where it takes place so you grab the

panties come down here with Sansa and

you get a scene that ends with you

seeing straight-up pussy you get the

beef curtains you get the whole meat of

vagina and I clearly can't speedrun that

so I decided to make it in any percent

route of just claiming some soiled

panties and I've set the world record as

expected as I usually do when I set my

mind to speedrunning a game so I'm

fucking happy with that bang I am now

the world record holder for game of

moans and probably one of the very few

porn game speedrunners out there

Getting A Chiseled Jawline Is Easy

it's time to put some Fitness on that

face you chubby cheeked greaseball

having no jawline is a disease our ball

gag is the cure looking like something

out of Fifty Shades of Grey this bad boy

I'll have people saying Fifty Shades oh

hey nice jawline my name is Brandon

Harris inventor and CEO of John's

Versailles and next in line to be

president of the Phi Kappa Alpha chapter

yeah it came to be one day on the beach

after fishing a dingleberry out of my

girl's ass and chewing on it a little

bit and I said wait a minute my jaw is

getting a little sore I recognized I was

getting a bit of a facial pump so I

added 40 pounds of resistance and Eureka

the jaws are size ball gag was born I

chew on this naughty little bastard

everywhere at the gym on the beach

sometimes people ask me hey are you

eating a beer koozie and I'll laugh at

them and say no it's a hands-free

workout workin all 57 muscles in my neck

and face not to mention the incredible

taste we've added a little bit of mint

flavor here and yet it still feels like

you're eating a garbage trucks tire it

is the only product that successfully

activates the over fifty-seven muscles

in your face and neck by confusing your

muscles into thinking that they're

trying to break down a shoe you're gonna

love the way it feels and looks to chew

jaws or size but don't just take my word

for it here's my friend you know jaws

are sizes okay see don't just take my

word for it you would be surprised the

amount of things you can do while jaws

are sizing why not go ahead and start

doing a little bit of lawn work while

getting some drawers or size going right

around the ball doing lawn work and jaws

are sizing next time you're at the gym

put it in the ball gag while lifting

some reps and next time someone asks hey

are you exercising say no you stupid

motherfucker I'm John sir sizing and

then start pointing at your biceps I

went through years of trial and error

chewing on all types of different things

from tennis balls to bowling balls but

sometimes I get toothaches and it just

wasn't the right fit and then I finally

found the right amount of ball gag and

thus finally we have a real Jazzercise

ball in production you can ride a

motorcycle while getting laid and jaws

are sizing the the possibilities are

endless

Weaponized Toilet Brush

just getting a little scrub and sniff

action going with the old shitter and

you're enjoying it so much you decide

why not share the flavor with the

bathroom floor to spread it around ooh

PU yucky smells like shit how's it going

everyone it's me the sphincter scientist

Joe Fowler also known as the Bill Nye of

butt holes here with the toilet spear

the tool that boldly goes were only my

face used to in high school let me show

you how it works we took the ergonomic

design of the human tongue put it on a

stick and we shove it down here and give

that shit a lick the flexible design

allows it to curl up and get the toilets

g-spot as well as just ramrod it right

down the middle I bet you're wondering

how it works let me show you I took the

design of the old Native American

arrowheads put it on a stick made it out

of rubber and put nipples on it but not

just any nipples they're made out of

silver so this is an effective weapon

against werewolves as well

whoops-a-daisy now embarrassing you

caught me just playing in my toilet with

my toilet spear one of my favorite

hobbies but just take a look at this

who wouldn't find this fun Wingardium

Leviosa

Avada Kedavra did you squat over your

goldfish bowl and pop your hemorrhoids

over it pretty fucked up situation and

ordinarily you'd be in deep shit with

these toilet brushes but luckily a

little ass explosion is no match for the

fearsomeness of the toilet spear I used

to lick my toilet bowl clean but now I

don't have to take a look at these

measurements the toilet spear is over 30

feet long allowing even the hand from

Sponge Bob to get a little action in the

toilet spear cleaning

I just punished this toilet with the

fattest shit stack of my life and I

cannot wait to clean it yes this

weaponized toilet brush is coming at you

at a modest price of $10 but just sit

right the fuck there I'm not done check

this shit out what's more fun than a

toilet spear to toilet spears for only

$10 now you can fight two toilets at the

same time as long as they're both within

arm's reach and no it's not available in

stores pussy you're gonna have to call

me on the phone I'm waiting

Atomic Wallet

hi there I'm a career criminal and

part-time anal acupuncture therapist

today I've got quite the haul here I

stole a mother's cell phone and a

twelve-year-old boys wallet now the

interesting thing about today's loot is

I didn't even need to resort to the

sledgehammer what the fuck it turns out

it was Shazam's wallet I stole oh my

goodness can you believe it it's

digivolve into the atomic charge wallet

you heard about the atomic bombs fat man

and little boy but have you heard about

the atomic fat boy little wallet man I

thought not but instead of bringing

destruction this bad boy brings sodden

panties your phone's out a battery in

CPR isn't working well luckily you

brought your atomic wallet which can

charge your phone up to 5% per hour and

the best part is if somebody comes by to

steal your phone at least they'll get

your wallet too invented by Tony Stark

this wallet is damn near indestructible

you couldn't even dent it with a

hydraulic press here's a demonstration

we tossed it on the road here and a

ghost on a bicycle came by and ran it

over no damage whatsoever so if you're

being hunted by poltergeists on bikes

while you're definitely in some deep

shit but at least they won't be able to

hurt your wallet if you're unsatisfied

with your atomic wallet attach it to a

balloon and send it to Jesus I'm sure

he'd appreciate it you little asshole

this wallet is well-equipped to carry up

to four packs of gum and at four sticks

of gum per pack you're looking at 2,000

sticks of gum in just this little

convenient carrying case

if you'd rather fill it with money

credit cards and treasured family photos

it can kinda do that to to some extent

but why would you want to do that when

you can bring dumb no this isn't a

container for my glasses it's my wallet

ma'am the names bond atomic bond and you

haven't felt comfort till you felt it

drop into your pocket and it comes with

RFID blocking technology which of course

stands for rotating fluoride independent

dildos let's give you a demonstration of

how this feature works you just casually

walk by a man who's made out of credit

card scanners and look at that he'd

blink thread which means he couldn't get

inside the RFID block the atomic wallet

and read your credit card either that

hurts because your credit card was made

out of paper now you put it in your old

wallet with real credit cards and bang

he's got all your information and he's

fucking your daughter could have been

avoided if you just cock-blocked them

with the RFID blocking atomic wallet

let's get a brief recap for all you slow

shits out there a little montage of the

atomic wallets usefulness

yeah I thought so I'll be expecting your

call for the order

Toilet Performs EDM Concert

goodness gracious that dream was

convincing I really thought Riley Reid

was on top of my penis no wonder I woke

up with a full load

I got a dump it all turning on the

bathroom light at nights like a fucking

flashbang and you'll miss the mark when

you peepee

enter the bowl light it's here to guide

your eyes and your penis right into the

bowl whoa did somebody drop the

tesseract in my toilet no that's just

the gentle nightlight delivered to you

thanks to the bold light that you can

clip on to any toilet and turn that

ordinary boring toilet do a fucking rave

in your bathroom that's right transform

any toilet into a nice little light up

show at an EDM concert and piss and shit

right in that bad boy what's up fam my

name's Jim I'm 18 years old and I

recently installed the bull light and

I've never looked back it's just really

amazing the things you can do with a

bull light it can change colors you can

have a go to blue and yellow if you want

to feel like you're pissing into the Sun

right if you want to feel like you're

looking into the portal the hell green

if you want to get real wild and feel

like you're dropping a stinker into the

mouth of the Hulk it's just amazing sing

it with me singing if you know the words

bathroom light is too bright when you

use it in the night saw grandma's tits

said yikes certainly not a pretty sight

often times my husband gets possessed by

diabetic demon and pisses multiple times

throughout the night but thanks to the

bull light I now wake up sometimes in

panic thinking there's aliens in the

bathroom I flushed my son's turtle down

the toilet and he cried for weeks so

then I went out and bought a bull light

and convinced him that the light was

proof that the turtle was becoming a

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle fucking

World's Manliest Hose

or you will be extravagant and

kicking ass now you just want to go home

and unwind by water in that beautiful

garden that you do plant it long ago

no she's moved on and happier without

you but god damn it that gardens got to

get maintained might as well use a hose

that this manly as you are

the Hercules garden hose

now let me ask you what is every garden

hose fear

that's right BattleBots circular saw

blades but not the Hercules hose normal

rubber hoses will spring leaks flooding

the atmosphere with testosterone block

and estrogen yucky bud with the Hercules

garden hose you could run it over with

the tire and it ain't even kinky

now let me tell you this secret it's the

adamantium coded plate and de blatant

iam utopian no it's a secret to

immortality right there that allows

water to flow and fire to go itself

be careful though gentlemen the Hercules

will please your wife better than you

ever could take my word on that one gun

dammit I miss you so much clarity

knowable it somebody say diarrhea

blaster that's the Hercules garden hose

middle name my friend now let's say

you're out in the wild and there's a

lawnmower just out for blood had a bad

day it'll cut that rubber hose in half

like a ten gallon hat and a wood chipper

but with the Hercules garden hose it'll

put the fear of God in any lawn mower

anti leak connectors means you'll never

get water out where you don't want the

water coming at now look at this year

old rusty dusted piece of looking

like a DNA helix if DNA stood for do not

assume your hose is better than the

Hercules cuz that bitch ain't not what

in tarnation what the did I just

tell you it's sprung a leak in the time

I was talking to you disgusting now look

at me take a blow torch to the Hercules

it don't feel it can take more

torch you're better than Jack Bauer in

24 are you still not impressed do you

not believe in the Hercules dream I

think it's time to make you a believer

we went diving with a real great white

man-eating shark and we'd put some bait

on the hose and he snatched it and

Hercules hose didn't budge not even a

little bit we could have strangled this

bitch if we wanted to but we didn't but

we did kill it need it

and we wash the boat off afterwards so

really I just don't know what you're

waiting for she's not coming back so you

might as well get a hose that's as manly

as you are you got hair on your chest

hair on your nutsack and hair on those

nuts in that sack you might as well have

a hose that's the same way call now

Picnic Ruiner

Oh yikes oh so heavy why did I fill my

cooler with bricks well I might as well

at least keep them cold for the kids no

one likes warm bricks

I wonder how meemaw and Peepaw is doing

with the cooler I filled with cinder

blocks shit someone pissed in the cooler

again rest in peace turkey sandwich

god damn you Phantom pisser if you

suffer from these very specific problems

have we got a solution for you

it's the chill chest this bitch is

lightweight it's foldable and presto

you can put shit in it we won't stop you

and the best part is you don't need any

ice because no matter what this isn't

gonna keep anything cold but we put dry

ice in there to give the effect that

this shit in here is cold you can't take

a chill chest on an airplane because it

looks like a weapons great but you can

take it on a camping trip cuz it weighs

less than 2 pounds let me put that

number into perspective for you that

means the chill chest weighs less than

an eight pound bowling ball how is it

even possible you're asking yourself

well let's take a peek under the hood

the chill chest is lined with over 1

million black licorice jelly beans

locked at 22 degrees Kelvin that's

bose-einstein condensate levels don't

believe me here science we filled both

with food we then fast-forward at our

clock an hour we came back in the cold

food we put in the chill chest was still

cold explain that math the warm food we

put in the ordinary cooler still warm

I'm kidding

fucking prank there it's just diarrhea

in there you have a juggler coming over

to perform for your kids birthday party

give him a platform to stand on with the

chill chest he trying to fuck my grandma

well she can still shoulder press to

mean penises food and drinks

Nature has taught us we need both to

survive now you can put both of them

into a chill chest will they'll stay ice

cold for no time at all

it folds flat for easy storage it does

not keep your groceries fresh sub-zero

could blast the chill chest with a

special movement it wouldn't cool

anything down inside ideal for boating

while you're catching fish ideal for

pranks if you're trying to scare people

with fish and that's not all keeps food

piping hot for hours scorching

temperatures inside of the chill chest

confirmed but it's perfect for parties

if you want to look like a douchebag

watch just run it over with a truck like

we do in every single commercial ever

fucking filmed and it still works just

like a charm

seems like you're getting mad chill out

The Real Gotham Pot

how many times have you boiled packing

peanuts and tried to kickflip them into

a strainer only to fuck it up entirely

and ruin old pop local bear's birthday

bash

I'm Daniel Green here with the latest in

Lucius Fox technology it's the Gotham

steel pasta pot it's got a glass lid

with a strainer it's a no-brainer the

people of Gotham have been crying out

for a better pasta pot and I'm here to

fucking deliver it's a twist in luck so

you give this bad boy a titty twister

not even Batman can find his way into

this this pasta will be safe what if I

told you perfect straining was

guaranteed would that put some grease in

your shit-stained I bet it would you

know the most incredible part no matter

what happens the handles will stay cool

they might as well be rockin and

undercut in a barbed wire tattoo they're

so fucking cool this pots new year's

resolution was to hit the gym and it's

paying off it can hold up to 5 pounds

now it's got a titanium core with a

beautiful layer of ceramic just shit

right over top of it creating a divine

symbiotic relationship between science

fiction and cooking utensils it never

scratches cuz it's never a chi no know

what you're thinking this shit stick

nope nothing sticks don't believe me

blow load in there and it'll slide out

every time here's an experiment

conducted by Yale where they used 1 cup

of dog vomit in a stainless steel pot

versus a Gotham pot on the right you can

at least pick it up and eat it later the

lid is made from the finest ballistic

glass imported directly from Fort Knox

meaning no matter how hard you hit it

with your miniature sledgehammer

you won't Harvey Dent it just look at

this fine craftsman shit look at these

holes you could grate cheese on them

what are you gonna do in your vegetable

start pissin you're gonna go grab your

Gotham steel pot to gobble it up cuz

it's a four quart pot it can hold more

urine than you can imagine as long as

you can't imagine 5 quarts food lobsters

body parts animals it doesn't matter

what you put in the Gotham pot it can

handle anything you know what they say

you either die a hero or you live long

enough to see yourself selling Gotham

steel pasta pots much like Batman I

became a Gotham steel pasta pot due to

my fear of the Gotham steel pasta pot

sprinkle some cheese on some goop you

found in a dumpster one of my special

secret recipes pop some popcorn in this

bitch popcorn goes great when watching

Batman it's perfect for making

disappointing rice krispies marshmallow

chocolate treats for the whole family to

not enjoy no more freestyling with the

pasta you fucking lunatic now we're

getting serious with the Gotham steel

pasta pot this is for serious chefs that

do serious pasta business for only $30

its years with

90 day guarantee that I will not give

your money back if you buy one I won't

give it back after 90 days either and

who wouldn't want the free tea sir Ram a

big slamma-jamma bonus that I'm thrown

in with this motherfucker that's an $80

value for only $30 so in the words of

Bane from The Dark Knight Rises when

your wallet is ashes because you spent

so much money on the Gotham steel pasta

pot then you have my permission to fry

The Real Sun Genie

we've all been there the electricity

goes out what we're fiddling with the

pepper and we start spanking a

flashlight it's time to cut that shit

out I'm Anthony Sully Sullivan here with

the Sun Jeannie listen up you ass anuses

I know this mason jar doesn't look like

much but it uses solar power meaning it

generates just as much power as our

entire solar system perfect for the kids

doesn't use batteries get those

batteries out of here I hate these

fucking things I'm throwing them right

off the roof they fucked my wife I'm

tired of them but unfortunately these

little glowing condoms are nearly

indestructible so it looks like it's

another sleepless night for me wondering

why Meredith left me their inflatable

they're infallible this is the only

genie you don't have to rub out instead

this genie will be rubbing you out they

even work underwater in case you want to

shoot a cool music video like this look

at this the Sully slide music video

official shit baby

regular lanterns only last 100 hours

this son genies last up to 3,000 hours

that's longer than the sun's ever

existed in fact scientists have proposed

using a Sun genie as a replacement for

the Sun when the Sun eventually fizzles

out too dark to find your oxycodone

don't worry son genies got your back to

help feed that addiction starred by a

lithium polymer battery I don't think

anyone gives a fuck with only one shard

you get 12 hours of light imagine what

you can do with 12 hours of light you

can walk a dog in the dark you can walk

yourself in the dark with the Sun genie

at your back you can do anything it's

also the perfect speed bump look at that

shit 3,400 pounds

that's so much the Sun Genie weighs and

I'm picking up with one hand I'm just so

fucking strong it's cool to touch you'll

be cool if you touch it it's cool to

tell it secret and be friends with it

replace the flux capacitor in your

time-traveling DeLorean with this shit

toast wine to it take it boating put it

in the first-aid kit as a joke so when

your buddy's bleeding out you say don't

worry bro got just what you need them

and without the Sun genie it'll be

really disappointed write a song for it

this genie doesn't grant any wishes

unless that wishes for 12 hours of

slight illumination regular lanterns are

heavy the Sun genies not heavy play it

like an accordion shove it in your

backpack it's also an excellent tool if

you're planning a robbery it's the

perfect crime and the slippery Sully

gets away again

regular lanterns are up to 40 dollars

that's bullshit batteries are bullshit

the Sun genie inflates like an air

mattress and costs a lot less than an

air mattress lifetime guarantee that it

costs less than an air mattress cry on

it it doesn't care it doesn't matter I'm

standing in space right now but you can

still reach me via telephone and if you

call me right now throw in a mini Genie

absolutely free no that shit looks like

a little plastic purse a smurf would

wear

but trust me you're going to want this

this is an incredible deal you get the

Sun Jeannie the mini Jeannie you don't

get any batteries with this so you're

never getting a good deal trick shot you

can walk up the stairs with it

the possibilities are truly limitless

biggest historical inaccuracy is the

claim that humans used to ride horses in

the battle that is entirely false they

used to ride their fathers into battle

to strike fear into their enemies real

men used to know how to pony up back in

those days the true golden era of Daddy

riding oh yeah and you can dress up when

riding your father too but who gives a

fuck call your dad see disc it because

he'll most likely be slipping a disc

anywhere from c1 to c7 and a cervical

spine when giving these exhilarating

pony rides

[Music]

[Applause]

these ass napkins come in all types of

different colors to embarrass your

parents with in the words of Albert

Einstein anyone who has never made a

mistake has never tried to pony up so

put down that iPad and get ready for a

pony ride I know you're probably

thinking these cost upwards of ten

thousand dollars but what if I told you

it's only $24.99 can you fucking smell

what The Rock is cooking unbelievably

low prices so this Christmas don't ask

for a skateboarder a bike when this

makes the perfect gift who needs to ride

one of those things when you can just

ride your parents in fact in a recent

interview with Tony Hawk they asked him

if he always wanted to ride skateboards

and he said no he wanted to ride his

daddy but just didn't have a saddle to

do it don't make the same fucking

mistakes Tony Hawk made it's time to

pony the fuck up daddy

The Real Hog Wash

are you moist yet you should be I'm

Anthony Sully Sullivan I'm holding the

face of a swine let me show you what I

can do with this poor member of the

Seward a family I can make it give this

shit crusted pan a rim job

I can gently rub it in this wine glass

I've never used I cannot so gently give

it a concussion while I fish out his

brother I've been drowning in my sink

really the possibilities are endless

with the hogwash this may look like a

fleshlight but it's actually many hog

washes working together to boldly go

where no pig has gone before this is the

future we've earned this scrubber is

tough so tough it makes graphene look

like an uncooked noodle and let's not

forget it never scratches you scratch

its back it won't scratch yours bitch

you don't need your cock in your hand

right now you're going to blow your load

anyway for all those times you vomit on

the stove just grab the old trusty

hogwash super scrubber and just get that

shit out of there

typically I like to use two hundred

pound dumbbells for my curls but for the

sake of this demonstration I'll use tens

as you can clearly see from the

scientific experiment the hogwash on the

Left remained hard and kept its cool

while the one on the right ate asshole

now for those of you concerned about the

environment and our word that we simply

dispose of the hogwash on the right let

me assure you that's not the case

the hogwash on the right will be

recycled and used in one of our other

products our brand of condoms known as

hogwash rubber so sleep easy knowing

nothing ever goes to waste at hogwash

headquarters I just can't stop pointing

at this naughty douchebag pig sponge and

you're not going to be able to stop

either you're gonna want to rub it on

anything and everything anything a real

pig face can be rubbed on the hogwash

scrubber can be rubbed on look at this

flimsy fuck right here what can this

even fuck it's dirty moldy and fuck you

have blood on your hog wash that's not a

problem simply run it under some cold

water and you got a clean hog wash again

wink winky son of a bitch fuck you yeah

get fingered cleaning glasses has never

been this much fun after you've severed

its jugular and carved your hogwash like

a pumpkin call a psychiatrist because

you are fucking lunatic pigs use these

for hearing so make sure your hogwash is

deaf by rubbing it in your grill grates

the hog wash is an exceptional

competitor when it comes to rubbing the

surface of something for no reason and

it won't ejaculate like the blue sponge

and it's scratch free guaranteed did a

homeless man leave soap on your

windshield after you bathe done

hogwash it you have tires hogwash them

do you just fucking love soap hogwash it

there's nothing you can't hogwash this

is my car it cost over five million

dollars and look at what I'm gonna do

I'm going to show the hogwash that this

is close it's ever going to get to

owning this vehicle no whoops looks like

it left some tears on my hood luckily I

have this rag the hog wash is made 100

percent in America which means we must

now change the national anthem to

include the hog wash in it you've seen

The Real Face Trainer

good afternoon viewer you're watching

the face trainer basic training

instructional video brought to you by

radiancy and no no it's in the game

I'm your host shitter this device is

what you get when beauty and diarrhea

amalgamate before you begin your

abstract expedition through the human

psyche using the face trainer you must

first learn the basic steps the first

step is learning the surprise puppy-dog

technique this move is integral to the

face trainer simply open your mouth as

though you'll be bobbing for apples

shortly then look straight up into the

sky the final product is look as though

you've just been hit by a fucking taser

now that you've mastered the basics it's

time to move on to some advanced

training so strap in you son of a bitch

now listen just because you paid $200

for this poorly designed Power Rangers

helmet doesn't mean you're entitled to a

good face training you need to put that

work in if you don't put that work in

the only thing your training is my

patience I'm not gonna sit here and

listen to your piss at the toilet seat

the under eye smoother once you're

wearing the face trainer and are

thoroughly embarrassed you can begin by

putting your fingers in this position

think of it as though you're about to

use the solar flare attack from Dragon

Ball Z then initiate the surprise

puppy-dog technique these two working

two hoots are guaranteed to drastically

reduce your self-esteem isn't that

wonderful let's have a recap of what the

fuck you just witnessed you saw the

surprise puppy-dog fingers in place head

back bring lower lid up I believe that's

supposed to be lip must be a typo

whoopsie and the puppy-dog face the

puppy-dog faces not to be confused with

the surprise puppy-dog so I'm sure

you're well aware those are two entirely

different emotions and go fuck yourself

think they're similar

this is a human face without skin the

smile lines no they start by going into

your surprise puppy dogs dance then put

your finger under your nose and in front

of your lips you should look like you're

telling a noisy giant to please be quiet

while he's in the library because you're

trying to read then give your finger a

little old smooch this exercise targets

both your willpower and your will to

live this is the ultimate form of

endurance and should be just what you

need to get that perfect facial training

I'm still here as you watch this

gentleman practice the smile line

smoothing technique I'd like to share a

few testimonials with you from our happy

customers the first one this is shit I

like shit

therefore I like this that one's for me

here's another if I could only take one

article of clothing to a club I'd take

this because then I could wander into

the women's bathroom pretend to be a

toilet seat and have a bunch of women

sit on my face that one is also from me

and that's all the testimonials we have

skinless face again folks the chin and

neck toner now that you realized

purchasing the face trainer was probably

a mistake it's time to punish yourself

for it

put your hands in a position that

simulates strangling yourself then look

up to the sky and perform a series of

complex you you lations if you have

managed to survive the chin and neck

toning procedure then congratulations

you have fucking trained your platies ma

you gave that bitch a workout and you

train your sternocleidomastoid also

known as the neck titties

the eye opener and forehead smoother

this is the most difficult technique

because for this you have to read the

mind of an alien this is no easy task I

can assure you of that

now as you can see she was unsuccessful

in contacting extraterrestrial beings on

that attempt however this does not daunt

her she still gives it a try and you

should too you should try the face

trainer now train your face train your

senses train your ass cheeks use it as a

Halloween costume and say you're a ninja

turtle I don't fucking care just order

this you could be sitting there not

training your shit or you could put this

bitch on and train the fuck out of your

shit

pick your phone up right now and call

the face training hippy 800 number and

order this the balls in your court so

what are you gonna do are you gonna ride

the train that takes you to work or are

you gonna ride the train that takes your

face to work

The Real Miss Utah

a recent report shows that in 40% of

American families with children women

are the primary earners yet they

continue to earn less than me what does

this say about society in order to

answer this inquiry we must first ask

ourselves why did cavemen invent the

wheel

I believe the Solarians told them to but

regardless with the advent of the wheel

we have things like the internet space

shuttles Lean Cuisine and lava lamps now

don't misconstrue my words miss Leakes

I'm not saying that we should stop

supplying our employees with titty milk

nor am i saying the government should

cut funding to odorless asshole projects

which seek to eliminate the stench of an

anus after its shit all I'm saying is

wheels exist now back to your question

in order to vanquish mosquitoes from

this world we need to fuck those useless

organisms up with some powerful shit
